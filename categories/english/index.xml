      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining &lt;strong&gt;state&lt;/strong&gt; is the main cause of complexity and headaches in software development: without a careful consideration of state, our projects will inevitably become impossible to understand. In fact, various development techniques and programming styles are mainly there to handle state in a responsible way: for example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;monads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as used in functional programming, are often employed for this very task. A good general way of managing state is trying to make it &lt;strong&gt;immutable&lt;/strong&gt;, either through the use &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_type&#34;&gt;value types&lt;/a&gt;, that is, types which instances are passed around with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy&#34;&gt;deep copy&lt;/a&gt; semantics, or simple &lt;em&gt;immutable objects&lt;/em&gt;, which have reference semantics but because they&amp;rsquo;re immutable their state is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the &lt;em&gt;processes&lt;/em&gt; we usually represent in code are all but immutable: the state of any running software is probably going to change as time passes, as a result of &lt;em&gt;foreign interactions&lt;/em&gt;, a.k.a., &lt;em&gt;side effects&lt;/em&gt;. This means that something, somewhere has to mutate, and to be more precise we can say that the information stored in a certain object is going to change: actually, an &lt;strong&gt;information&lt;/strong&gt; by itself is a &lt;strong&gt;constant&lt;/strong&gt; value, but from time to time that object is going to store different pieces of information, some are going to be new, others are going to be outdated. So there&amp;rsquo;s no escape from mutation: the point is to mutate &lt;strong&gt;responsibly&lt;/strong&gt;, that is, to not be reckless with our mutable objects, and treat them in a special way so that we can still reason about our code and easily understand the state of our system at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The already cited techniques based on monads represent a good way to solve the problem, but monads only really work in a functional programming context, something that&amp;rsquo;s not everyone&amp;rsquo;s cup of tea, and to be really productive while using them you need to &lt;em&gt;think in terms of monads&lt;/em&gt;, and treat them as primitive objects. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about monads or functional programming in general, my focus for this article is analyzing mutability in software, while identifying common techniques that can be leveraged in any programming language/paradigm to improve our code. In particular I want to talk about 3 specific problems that arise while working with mutable objects, and 3 solutions to address them. To quickly summarize, my suggestions will be the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be idempotent;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;react to change;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proceed one-way only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see each one of them in detail by developing a concrete example: an object that represents a &lt;em&gt;payment process&lt;/em&gt;, which at any moment can be in various states, like &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;succeeded&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;failed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-idempotent&#34;&gt;Be idempotent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mutate an object from the outside we usually &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; the object to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something. If we truly want to respect the object-oriented paradigm, and in particular if we don&amp;rsquo;t want to violate &lt;strong&gt;encapsulation&lt;/strong&gt;, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t make assumptions about the internal state of a certain object after a certain method call; still, we cannot help but making assumptions about the way our entire &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt; is going to work after a method call, otherwise it would be impossible to reason about code. But if our changes are &lt;em&gt;incremental&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be really hard to understand the system even after a simple method call. Not all changes are created equal: if the resulting system&amp;rsquo;s state is affected by the previous one, before the change takes place, then it&amp;rsquo;s going to be basically impossible to reason about the system after the change, because in our reasoning we should take into account all the possible conditions the system was in. An incremental change, for example a method call to &lt;em&gt;increase a counter&lt;/em&gt;, will overload our mind of conditional paths and will cause bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, for our &lt;code&gt;PaymentProcess&lt;/code&gt; we don&amp;rsquo;t want to be able to generically &lt;em&gt;advance&lt;/em&gt; the payment state: we want to advance it to a particular stage, with a clean method call that should be &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;idempotent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that is, calling it 1 time, 2 times or 100 times &lt;strong&gt;has to be the same&lt;/strong&gt;. This also means that if more objects call the same method, it will be like if only one object called it, and this will completely remove a running cause of bugs: multiple, uncoordinated interactions of the same type with an object. Idempotence is a simple concept, but it&amp;rsquo;s extremely powerful: with it, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep track if a particular operation has already occurred (thus saving some state), but to properly implement it we need the correct semantics: while &lt;em&gt;delta&lt;/em&gt; operations are very frequent in real life (think about increasing the volume of a TV set) and are usually harmless, they can be dangerous in software development, an in general it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand the what &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; natural in real life is not necessarily a good thing in software engineering, or engineering in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, notice that while an idempotent method call will always have the same result on a particular instance, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that will have the same result on &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; instances - more on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;react-to-change&#34;&gt;React to change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reactivemanifesto.org&#34;&gt;Reactive programming&lt;/a&gt; has been big the last few years, and that&amp;rsquo;s mostly thanks both to the popularity achieved by functional programming in OOP circles, and to the diffusion of architectures based on microservices. But the idea of &lt;em&gt;being reactive&lt;/em&gt; in software development has been around for much more than that: for example, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;observer pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been there for decades, and the basic underlying idea is that of &lt;em&gt;connecting&lt;/em&gt; objects by establishing relations between them in which a state change is automatically propagated to a collection of &lt;em&gt;observers&lt;/em&gt;. It is responsibility of an observer to react to what just happened, while the &lt;em&gt;observable&lt;/em&gt; object doesn&amp;rsquo;t really care about what the others will do. This will allow us to achieve the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a nice &lt;em&gt;decoupling&lt;/em&gt; between a mutable object and other objects that for any reason are interested in its mutation; no custom interface will be needed, just a simple fixed method (like &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;) to pass around the new information;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a more &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt; code style, in which our method calls will only describe the intent of connecting one or more objects to a chain of reactions (and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754&#34;&gt;functional reactive programming&lt;/a&gt; is particularly good a that).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About our payment example, whatever object is interested in a change of state, like for example UI objects the will show different views to the user based on the current payment stage, should really subscribe to our payment object to receive &lt;em&gt;signals&lt;/em&gt; about its mutation: the payment object itself should then send these changes to the observers. Notice that I used the  word &lt;em&gt;send&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;broadcast&lt;/em&gt;: the change of state of a particular object should usually not be treated as an all-encompassing &lt;em&gt;event&lt;/em&gt;. Events are really about application wide changes (like a phone call during the execution of a mobile application): there are many ways to implement our observables and observers, the point is simply to have a clean, fixed API to &lt;em&gt;emit&lt;/em&gt; an information, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://reactivex.io&#34;&gt;ReactiveX&lt;/a&gt; could be a nice starting point to get an idea about the possible APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;proceed-one-way-only&#34;&gt;Proceed one-way only&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be controversial but it&amp;rsquo;s extremely important. Consider the following case: our payment process object has idempotent methods and a reactive API, so a view controller object can keep a UI updated and send back user interactions to advance the process. But while the process is in &amp;ldquo;working&amp;rdquo; stage something goes wrong and the process fails: not a problem, we actually considered the &amp;ldquo;failed&amp;rdquo; stage, so the &lt;code&gt;PaymentProcess&lt;/code&gt; is updated accordingly. But we would actually like to retry the payment, and of course update everything accordingly in our reactive chain. What should we do? Set our &lt;code&gt;PaymentProcess&lt;/code&gt; back to &amp;ldquo;working&amp;rdquo;? That would be possible, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to make everything more complex, because all the observers should in theory take into account the fact the this is not the first attempt to pay (the UI for example could show a &amp;ldquo;retry&amp;rdquo; message instead of the usual one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, we want to &lt;em&gt;solve&lt;/em&gt; a state problem, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to distribute it to multiple objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case could be a complete stop of the payment process (the user could cancel it, for example, or the session could expire): we don&amp;rsquo;t want to bring back the &lt;code&gt;PaymentProcess&lt;/code&gt; instance, forcing all observer to do some kind of cleanup. In any case, a process that goes back and forth makes reasoning about code really hard, because &lt;strong&gt;it makes the future more complex&lt;/strong&gt;: all the objects that depend on a mutable object are going to be easier to implement if we can assume that the mutability will only proceed in one direction. Of course this is not easy to implement, but in this case it&amp;rsquo;s really natural to think about it: if the milk is running out in the evening, I cannot expect the bottle to magically refill for the morning, so I should start thinking about a different breakfast. Processes that are invertible usually require some form of external, high-level coordination, and from an architectural standpoint the idea of an object that mutates in any possible way might seem harmless: but at the implementation level this will cause problems, and bugs are in the implementation, not in the architecture. While implementing new features, refactoring, debugging or simply studying a codebase we reason about the code, not the architecture, and &lt;em&gt;coordinator&lt;/em&gt; objects are classic jack-of-all-trades at the architecture level: but unfortunately, an implementation that requires external coordination is going to be more complex and error-prone, so it&amp;rsquo;s better to be clear about the mutation path for an object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our particular case, we could consider one or more &amp;ldquo;retry&amp;rdquo; stages, or a single &amp;ldquo;retry&amp;rdquo; stage with an associated object that represents the number of retries. And about the possibility of going back to the beginning, in that case we should really &lt;strong&gt;discard the whole process&lt;/strong&gt;: the process owner, that would have likely activated the various accessory objects (like the ones for the UI) should &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; for an &amp;ldquo;abort&amp;rdquo; stage, that would make it kill everything and start the process anew. There might be performance concerns: to mutate objects is usually faster than recreating them, but again, it can be managed and it&amp;rsquo;s better to have cleaner, more understandable code from the beginning, so that it&amp;rsquo;s going to be easier to make fine calibrations in later stages, than to create a mess in the name of early optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final question: if the process is one-way only, what happens if some object tries to set it to a previous stage with a method call? &lt;strong&gt;Absolutely nothing&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;ignore-if-impossible&lt;/em&gt; semantics is actually clean and reasonable, and we don&amp;rsquo;t need errors or exceptions to handle: even if this has to be taken into account at every method call, the important thing is to be &lt;strong&gt;clear&lt;/strong&gt; about it, and the alternative is much worse. This whole article could be summarized in the phrase &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;clear semantics are what makes mutability bearable&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. In this particular case, the fact that a method call is ignored or not doesn&amp;rsquo;t change our reasoning: I&amp;rsquo;m not going to make assumptions about the state of &lt;code&gt;PaymentProcess&lt;/code&gt; after the call, because I&amp;rsquo;m actually reacting to its changes in a separate context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We considered a bunch of possible problems to think about when implementing mutable objects, and some options to confront them. Of course these ideas are purposely very general: every problem is different, every codebase is unique. But applying even just one of these techniques will most likely result in more clear and understandable code. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t talk about application-wide mutation, because that&amp;rsquo;s really an architectural thing; my goal is to raise awareness about the concept of mutation and variable instance properties in every single class. We should always &lt;strong&gt;avoid&lt;/strong&gt; mutation when possible, and concentrate our variable state in a few, carefully controlled places; but if we&amp;rsquo;re not careful, even a single mutating class in a multiple class project could wreak havoc, and force use to debug and fix a system that we thought was clean and well structured.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;«Learn or die»&lt;/em&gt;. These are the words with which &lt;a href=&#34;http://milan2016.codemotionworld.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codemotion Milan 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; started on the 25th of November. Most of our development team attended this tech conference like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/blog/ita/facile-it-devs-codemotion-milan-2015/&#34;&gt;previous year&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facile.it&#34;&gt;Facile.it&lt;/a&gt; was present at the event as a sponsor with his stand looking for new talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the event we also officially &lt;strong&gt;announced the second &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackathon.facile.it/&#34;&gt;#FacileHack&lt;/a&gt; hackathon&lt;/strong&gt;, which is planned for &lt;strong&gt;march 2017&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post would be a short recap of some talks in chronological order. The choice of the talks is based on the personal taste of the various members of the editorial staff of Facile.it Engineering blog. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/codemotion-2016-in-review/codemotion_2016.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A part of Facile Dev Team&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-new-features-of-php-7&#34;&gt;The new features of PHP 7&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enrico Zimuel (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ezimuel&#34;&gt;@ezimuel&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11:30 – 12:10 #programming (&lt;a href=&#34;http://zimuel.it/slides/codemotion2016/&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enrico Zimuel, Software Engineer at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zend.com/&#34;&gt;Zend Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind the PHP engine, talks about some of the new features of PHP 7: the scalar type and return type declarations, the spaceship and null coalescing operators, the anonymous classes, the consistent 64-bit support, etc. Furthermore he explains why PHP 7 is twice as fast compared to the previous version and it has 30% lower memory consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-and-lastminute-com-our-course-towards-better-scalability-and-processes&#34;&gt;Kubernetes and lastminute.com: our course towards better scalability and processes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michele Orsi (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/micheleorsi&#34;&gt;@micheleorsi&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11:30 – 12:10 #devops (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/micheleorsi/kubernetes-and-lastminutecom-our-course-towards-better-scalability-and-processes&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastminute.com recently started a migration from a monolithic app to a microservice approach, leveraging the power of Kubernetes, the open source project lead by Google for container orchestration. This was quite the effort, and it unveiled a great deal of advantages and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;continuous-budgeting&#34;&gt;Continuous budgeting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Francesco Fullone (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fullo&#34;&gt;@fullo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:10 - 15:50 #inspirational&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is about being agile in the entrepeneur side of our profession: how to plan and adapt to change when deciding how and how much to spend in our coding ventures; re-evaluating is key, and the only way to success is a delicate balance between maintenance and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-65k-and-beyond&#34;&gt;To ∞ (~65K) and beyond!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sebastiano Gottardo (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rotxed&#34;&gt;@rotxed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16:10 - 16:50 #mobile (&lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/dextor/to-65k-and-beyond&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of old -but still widely used- Android devices are natively limited to run apps with less than 65K method references (due to the Dalvik JVM). For many apps this could be a serious problem. During the talk Sebastiano, an Android engineer at Musixmatch, gave a very comprehensive and clear explanation of the problem and went through all the possible solutions showing some really useful tips to deal or better &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;functional-reactive-programming-with-kotlin-on-android&#34;&gt;Functional Reactive Programming with Kotlin on Android&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giorgio Natili (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/giorgionatili&#34;&gt;@giorgionatili&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17:10 - 17:50 #mobile (&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxCm4NRlzb3PWjNNaG1KS0Utckk/view&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of this talk was very interesting considering the fact that both the functional paradigm and the Kotlin language are used within the Facile.it Android app. But actually I have to say that I found a 40 minutes talk not suitable as a format to address these two large topics together (72 slides!). I would have preferred two separate talks, but it was nevertheless an interesting presentation full of useful tips and advices about Kotlin and FRP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coding-culture&#34;&gt;Coding Culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sven Peters (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/svenpet&#34;&gt;@svenpet&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:30 - 11:10 #inspirational (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/svenpeters/coding-culture&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his keynote Sven Peters, Evangelist for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atlassian.com/&#34;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;, explains - in a very geek style - what is &lt;em&gt;company culture&lt;/em&gt;, referring in particular to his company. He says that when people work in a great coding culture they are motivated and they are mostly very productive, but also they will have more responsibility and investment in the features they are developing. Developers will have more freedom to change their roles and try out new stuff, this is the right way to make better products with happier developers. He concluded his speech with these words: &lt;em&gt;«Products may change, but never forget values, cultivate your culture!»&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;micromonolith-top-anti-patterns-of-adopting-distributed-system&#34;&gt;MicroMonolith - Top anti-patterns of adopting distributed system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michal Franc (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/francmichal&#34;&gt;@francmichal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12:30 – 13:10 #architectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Michal reports his (and his team) experience in the infamous transistion from a monolithic app to a microservice oriented architecture. Michal works at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JustGiving&#34;&gt;@JustGiving&lt;/a&gt;, which mainly uses .NET, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t focus on the specific technology, but rather on the generic problems and pitfalls that this kind of transition brings to the table. During his tale, he laid to us a lot of useful suggestions and common issues to look for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;develop-applications-in-big-data-era-with-scala-and-spark&#34;&gt;Develop applications in Big Data Era with Scala and Spark&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mario Cartia (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mariocartia&#34;&gt;@mariocartia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12:30 – 13:10 #cloud #bigdata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large amount of data are produced everyday and Big Data is a concept increasingly trendy. In his talk Mario Cartia presented Scala and Spark,two powerful tools suitable to Big Data Processing.  Scala is a General purpose programming language that combines the benefits of OOP and functional programming. Apache Spark is an open source framework and it&amp;rsquo;s a fast engine for big data processing, based on Scala language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gang-of-four-patterns-in-a-functional-light&#34;&gt;Gang of Four Patterns in a Functional Light&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mario Fusco (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mariofusco&#34;&gt;@mariofusco&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:10 – 14:50 #programming (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mariofusco/from-gof-to-lambda&#34;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this live-coding talk, Mario Fusco uses Java (and new Java 1.8 features) to translate the wide-known GoF design patterns into functional programming, making the code a lot less verbose, reducing the noise of boilerplate over the really important code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, kittens:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Every year the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.grusp.org/&#34;&gt;GrUSP&lt;/a&gt;, in cooperation with one of the italian PHP user groups, organizes the italian &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://symfony.com/&#34;&gt;Symfony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; conference. This year the &lt;a href=&#34;http://2016.symfonyday.it/&#34;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; was organized in the Capital on 28th October with the help of &lt;a href=&#34;http://roma.grusp.org/&#34;&gt;PHP User Group Roma&lt;/a&gt;, and a part of Facile Dev Team was there for the occasion. In Facile we believe attending to events like this is a good way to learn new things, share practical experiences and improve our network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post would be a short recap of all the talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/looking-back-at-symfony-day-rome-2016/faciledev_symfonyday_2016.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A part of Facile Dev Team&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;symfony-and-micro-not-so-much-service&#34;&gt;Symfony and micro (not so much) service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_orso_&#34;&gt;Michele Orselli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michele Orselli presented a case study of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application&#34;&gt;monolithic application&lt;/a&gt; broken down into many smaller microservices. How many ways can we split a webapp? Why smaller is better? How services can interact each other? In his talk Michele answered all those questions focusing on all the advantages of the proposed architecture and a few common pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scaling-symfony-apps&#34;&gt;Scaling Symfony apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mat_teo8&#34;&gt;Matteo Moretti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 45 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A scalable application must support an increasing amount of data or a growing number of users. In his talk, Matteo Moretti described the architecture needed to scale. He divided the overall architecture into 4 main components: web server, sessions, database and the filesystem. He explained the right configuration to his main purpose: improving performance of a webapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;e-commerce-with-symfony-from-case-study-to-reality&#34;&gt;E-commerce with Symfony: from case study to reality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dymissy&#34;&gt;Simone D&amp;rsquo;Amico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sylius, Elcodi, Thelia, Sonata Project, Well Commerce, Shop Plus, Aimeos: these are the most popular results you can find if you google  &amp;ldquo;e-commerce solution with Symfony&amp;rdquo;. But which one is the final winner? Why choosing one or another? Simone D&amp;rsquo;Amico reviewed all of these frameworks and libraries comparing strengths and drawbacks. Moreover he clarified the stack he used to build an e-commerce platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-journey-into-symfony-form-component&#34;&gt;A journey into Symfony form component&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SamueleLilli&#34;&gt;Samuele Lilli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 45 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html&#34;&gt;Symfony form component&lt;/a&gt; is the main obstacle for beginners and newbies in the Symfony world. Samuele Lilli gave a talk with the purpose to clarify this hot topic with a lot of examples and code snippets. He started from the simplest form examples to more advanced ones. He revealed a lot of tips and explanations for several scenarios in order to make this powerful component understandable and manageable by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;php7-and-rich-domain-model&#34;&gt;PHP7 and Rich Domain Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/garakkio&#34;&gt;Massimiliano Arione&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk Massimiliano Arione told about his experience in the migration to PHP7 of a Symfony based project. Particularly he focused on the usage of type hinting and return types and the issues encountered with an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemic_domain_model&#34;&gt;Anemic Domain Model&lt;/a&gt; approach suggested by the framework official documentation. He showed how to combine a Rich Domain Model without giving up new language features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;relevance-sorting-with-elasticsearch-and-a-bit-of-maths&#34;&gt;Relevance sorting with Elasticsearch &amp;amp; a bit of maths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mattbit_&#34;&gt;Matteo Dora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 45 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main topic of the talk was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch&#34;&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt;. Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine with a great Symfony integration. Matteo Dora, the speaker of this talk, explained how to deal when the sorting by relevance becomes hard using the right amount of math and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSElasticaBundle&#34;&gt;FOSElasticaBundle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MessagePack: an alternative to JSON?</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/message-pack-an-alternative-to-json/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/message-pack-an-alternative-to-json/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about data interchange in web applications, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.json.org/&#34;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the de-facto standard, especially in developing RESTful web services. JSON won against its antagonist &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/XML/&#34;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; (SOAP) without a battle, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t prevent the development of alternatives like &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/&#34;&gt;Google’s &lt;strong&gt;Protocol Buffers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://avro.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache &lt;strong&gt;Avro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://msgpack.org/&#34;&gt;MessagePack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In being thorough, we should also mention &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gzip.org/&#34;&gt;gzip&lt;/a&gt; JSON compression (sometimes called &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;JSONC&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://bsonspec.org/&#34;&gt;BSON&lt;/a&gt;, a bin­ary-en­coded seri­al­iz­a­tion of JSON-like doc­u­ments, both derived directly from JSON. In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss MessagePack in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/message-pack-an-alternative-to-json/msgpack.png&#34; alt=&#34;MessagePack&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;JSON Vs MessagePack (source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://msgpack.org/&#34;&gt;msgpack.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-messagepack&#34;&gt;What is MessagePack?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;« &lt;em&gt;MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it&amp;rsquo;s faster and smaller&lt;/em&gt; ». To start using MessagePack we need to convert our application objects into MessagePack format: this process is called &lt;em&gt;serialization&lt;/em&gt;, while the reverse process is called &lt;em&gt;deserialization&lt;/em&gt;. The following example can help us better understand what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about. Consider this simple JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
	&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 4,                    // integer
	&amp;quot;isActive&amp;quot;: true,           // boolean
	&amp;quot;fullname&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Homer Simpson&amp;quot; // string
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSON requires 56 bytes to represent a very simple user object, while MessagePack only needs 38 bytes (compression ratio 1.47, yielding a 32% saving in size). See below the output of the serialization process for the above JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;83 a2 69 64 04 a8 69 73 41 63 74 69 76 65 c3 a8 66 75 6c 6c 6e 61 6d 65 ad 48 6f 6d 65 72 20 53 69 6d 70 73 6f 6e
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see how MessagePack serialization works by reading the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md&#34;&gt;official specification&lt;/a&gt;. Also, we can split the previous hexadecimal representation to emphasize and explain data types as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;83                                          // 3-element map
a2 69 64                                    // 2-byte string &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;
04                                          // integer 4
a8 69 73 41 63 74 69 76 65                  // 8-byte string &amp;quot;isActive&amp;quot; 
c3                                          // boolean true
a8 66 75 6c 6c 6e 61 6d 65                  // 8-byte string &amp;quot;fullname&amp;quot;
ad 48 6f 6d 65 72 20 53 69 6d 70 73 6f 6e   // 13-byte string &amp;quot;Homer Simpson&amp;quot;
                                            // total 38 bytes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s very simple to figure out the meaning of the sentence « &lt;em&gt;Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves&lt;/em&gt; » reported in the headline of MessagePack website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main features of MessagePack are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s designed for network communication and to be transparently converted from and to JSON;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it supports in-place updating, so it&amp;rsquo;s possible to modify part of a stored object without reserializing it as a whole;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has a flexible &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call&#34;&gt;Remote Procedure Call (RPC)&lt;/a&gt; and streaming API implementation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it supports &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking&#34;&gt;static-type-checking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;supported-data-types&#34;&gt;Supported data types&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data types listed by the specification are very similar to those in JSON, that is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integer&lt;/strong&gt; represents an &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boolean&lt;/strong&gt; represents &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nil&lt;/strong&gt; represents &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Float&lt;/strong&gt; represents a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point&#34;&gt;IEEE 754&lt;/a&gt; double precision floating point numbers including &lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Infinity&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;String&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;raw type&lt;/code&gt; and it represents a UTF-8 string;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binary&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;raw type&lt;/code&gt; and it represents a binary data using byte array;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Array&lt;/strong&gt; represents a sequence of objects;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map&lt;/strong&gt; represents a dictionary (key-value pairs of objects);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extension&lt;/strong&gt; represents a tuple of data whose meaning is defined by applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-naive-benchmark&#34;&gt;A naive benchmark&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point our reasoning was focused on &lt;strong&gt;space efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;, but a good theoretical computing scientist would have criticized us since we didn&amp;rsquo;t mention &lt;strong&gt;time complexity&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, the process of data &lt;em&gt;compression&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;decompression&lt;/em&gt; is not negligible. We can analyze and compare, for example, the time required to parse a JSON document and to unpack a MessagePack document: that&amp;rsquo;s not completely scientific, but it&amp;rsquo;s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrote two &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/en/&#34;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; scripts to execute 1 million JSON parsing and 1 million MessagePack unpacking operations of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/salvatorecordiano/facile-it-message-pack-benchmark/blob/master/document.json&#34;&gt;sample document&lt;/a&gt; containing the same data in the two formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simplified version of the code could be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;// inside script &amp;quot;test_parse_json.js&amp;quot;
for (var i = 0;i&amp;lt;1000000;i++) {
    JSON.parse(jsonDocument); // JSON document parsing
}

// inside script &amp;quot;test_unpack_msgpack.js&amp;quot;
for (var i = 0;i&amp;lt;1000000;i++) {
    msgpack.unpack(msgPackDocument); // MessagePack document unpacking
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To easily profile our scripts we can run them as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;aiace:msgpack parallel$ time node test_parse_json.js

real	0m47.296s
user	0m47.202s
sys	0m0.059s

aiace:msgpack parallel$ time node test_unpack_msgpack.js

real	1m47.244s
user	1m47.050s
sys	0m0.120s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers are self-explanatory: the MessagePack binary is &lt;em&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt; than the minified JSON, but MessagePack deserialization is clearly &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; than JSON parsing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going on, we also need to say that all tests are executed in the following described environment and the full code of this benchmark is free available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/salvatorecordiano/facile-it-message-pack-benchmark/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;// Machine

CPU: 2.200 MHz Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770HQ CPU @ 2.20GHz

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MessagePack allows to save more than 40% of network bandwidth consumption with little more than one line of code. A smaller payload means that less data are transmitted, and that&amp;rsquo;s very useful in &lt;strong&gt;mobile&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet of Things (IoT)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; applications, where there&amp;rsquo;s special care in power efficiency; but we should also pay attention to the overall size of each request, to avoid the absurd situation in which the &lt;em&gt;header&lt;/em&gt; is larger than the &lt;em&gt;payload&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(computing)&#34;&gt;overhead&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to underline that, while MessagePack is supported by over &lt;a href=&#34;http://msgpack.org/#languages&#34;&gt;50 programming languages&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be particularly efficient from a computational perspective, and can be hard to debug due to being non human-readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/kotlin-intro/logo_Kotlin.svg&#34; alt=&#34;Kotlin&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java is an &lt;strong&gt;old&lt;/strong&gt; programming language. Version 1.0 was released in 1996 by Sun Microsystems and  even though it has evolved and grown a lot over the past twenty years it is still carrying on some bad design choices such as &lt;em&gt;null&lt;/em&gt; (ask &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare?section=3#Apologies_and_retractions&#34;&gt;Tony Hoare&lt;/a&gt;), primitive types or lack of a proper function type. With the last version of the language (Java 8) Java tried to address some of these problems introducing concepts such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html&#34;&gt;lambda expression&lt;/a&gt;. Although these additions clearly represent a step forward for the language I still have the feeling that they are just &lt;em&gt;patches&lt;/em&gt; applied to &lt;strong&gt;mitigate problems&lt;/strong&gt; and not to solve them at their very source. For example &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; could be used to reduce NPE (Null Pointer Exception) but it is clearly not designed for &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mariofusco/status/780770300178956289&#34;&gt;this purpose&lt;/a&gt; and lambda expressions, implemented in Java 8 with SAM types, still force you to write an interface only to define a &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-android-world&#34;&gt;The Android world&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above concerns about Java are even more problematic within the Android world where, due to the notorious &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html&#34;&gt;fragmentation&lt;/a&gt; (a huge amount of devices are stuck with an &lt;strong&gt;outdated VM&lt;/strong&gt;), you are forced to target lower Java versions (6 and 7).
Google is addressing the problem with its new compiler &lt;a href=&#34;https://source.android.com/source/jack.html&#34;&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; that enables &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the features of Java 8 maintaining backward compatibility with older OS versions. But still it lets us deal with the verbosity of the language and it doesn’t truly solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-hope&#34;&gt;A new hope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/kotlin-intro/kotlin_helloworld.png&#34; alt=&#34;Kotlin Hello World!&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011 the JetBrains team (the guys behind IntelliJ and so Android Studio) unveiled &lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org/&#34;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt;, a new programming language that targets the JVM (and can also be compiled to JavaScript).
Kotlin is a statically-typed language that combines Object Oriented and functional features enforcing no particular philosophy of programming, and it introduces a whole new set of concepts and tools that helps making the code &lt;strong&gt;safer, cleaner and much more readable&lt;/strong&gt;.
Thanks to its nature it works everywhere Java do and it is also &lt;strong&gt;interoperable&lt;/strong&gt; with it, meaning it will not force you to rewrite the entire codebase to taste it: you can add it to your project a little at a time (&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@sergii/using-kotlin-for-tests-in-android-6d4a0c818776#.lyvd3h43x&#34;&gt;maybe starting with tests&lt;/a&gt; 😉). It also features a REPL &lt;code&gt;kotlinc-jvm&lt;/code&gt; that allows you to test language features with no effort (see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html#running-the-repl&#34;&gt;doc&lt;/a&gt; form more info).
I am going to rapidly cover some features of Kotlin that address the previously mentioned Java limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;null-safety&#34;&gt;Null-safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kotlin &lt;strong&gt;a variable cannot be null&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want or need a variable to be &lt;em&gt;nullable&lt;/em&gt; you have to add &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to the variable type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34;&gt;val x: Int = null // compile error
val y: Int? = null // ok
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this information the compiler sees &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Int?&lt;/code&gt; as two completely different types and can therefore enforce the &lt;a href=&#34;http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html&#34;&gt;null-safety&lt;/a&gt; of your variables.
The &lt;code&gt;?.&lt;/code&gt; allows you to safe call methods on nullable variables without throwing NPE but simply returning null at the end of the  call chain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34;&gt;val x: Int? = null
x?.toString()?.substring(2) // no NPE, returns null
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; operator (Elvis operator) allows you to provide a “default” value when the variable is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34;&gt;// The two expressions are semantically equivalent:
text?.length ?: -1
(text.length != null) ? text.length  : -1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;higher-order-functions-and-lambdas&#34;&gt;Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kotlin is possible to declare a method (or more generally a function) that returns or takes another &lt;strong&gt;function as parameter&lt;/strong&gt;. The syntax to define the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html&#34;&gt;function type&lt;/a&gt; is similar to other languages such as Scala or Swift and is very &lt;strong&gt;intuitive&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34;&gt;val function: (T1, T2) -&amp;gt; R = {t1, t2 -&amp;gt; r}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-classes&#34;&gt;Data classes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34;&gt;data class City(val name: String, val state: String)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html&#34;&gt;Data classes&lt;/a&gt; address the verbosity of Java when dealing with classes that have the only purpose to hold data. With a single line you get &lt;code&gt;equals()/hashCode()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; and getters/setters for free (and if you are a Java developer you already knows the benefits!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java has to maintain backward compatibility with previous versions and still has to support the huge amount of developers and codebases present all around the world; therefore it is natural that every new feature and design change is to be considered, weighted and reasoned really carefully, inevitably &lt;strong&gt;slowing down its evolution&lt;/strong&gt;. But this does not have to mean that us, as Android developers, “tied” to the JVM, should not try more modern and advanced languages such as Kotlin. At bottom, a part of our job (one of the best!) is to try and &lt;strong&gt;experiment&lt;/strong&gt; new technologies and to &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt; new concepts and techniques that improve our ability to address problems in the best possible way (and of course, to have some fun 😄).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that it is fundamental for a software engineer to be &lt;strong&gt;exposed to more than a single programming language&lt;/strong&gt;: learning new patterns, exploring other programming paradigms or simply using and understanding a never-seen syntax has an immeasurable value for our growth and most of the times it turns out to be unexpectedly useful even when coding with ”our” language.
So why not do it with a language that allows us to continue working on projects targeting our beloved JVM?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Event-driven serverless applications</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/event-driven-serverless-applications/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/event-driven-serverless-applications/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;If we think about computing in the Cloud Era, our mind is immediately drawn towards virtual machines and containers. Therefore, for example, when building a production environment with both approaches we think about the need of patching the operating system and/or upgrading the container. At the end of 2014 &lt;strong&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/strong&gt; (AWS) announced a new service called &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&#34;&gt;Lambda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, that allows us to focus on business logic and not on infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-lambda&#34;&gt;What is Lambda?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported on their website: « &lt;em&gt;AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code highly-available in the cloud in response to events and it automatically performs all the administration of the compute resources for you&lt;/em&gt; ». In the previous sentence is condensed all the power of Lambda, that we can summarize with the following key concepts: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#serverless-architecture&#34;&gt;serverless architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#high-availability&#34;&gt;high-availability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#event-driven&#34;&gt;event-driven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#zero-administration&#34;&gt;zero administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/event-driven-serverless-applications/aws-lambda-key-concepts.png&#34; alt=&#34;AWS Lambda key concepts&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;serverless-architecture&#34;&gt;Serverless architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lambda is completely &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo;, a term that can be considered misleading: obviously Lambda uses physical servers to run your code, but we, as the service&amp;rsquo;s users, don’t take care of everything required to do it. We just need to upload our code on AWS console and it handles capacity, scaling, monitoring, logging and security without any server to manage.
Strictly speaking, functions are executed in containers, and kernel-based virtualization is very useful in this context, because it allows to build multiple isolated environments in short time.
A more detailed explanation of serverless architectures can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;high-availability&#34;&gt;High-availability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Lambda maintains compute capacity across multiple availability zones in each region - at the moment there are 8 regions distributed among Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific - in this way Lambda is able to protect your code against data center failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;event-driven&#34;&gt;Event-driven&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Event-driven&amp;rdquo; means that a Lambda function is triggered when an event occurs, so the flow of the application is mainly driven by events. In this kind of architecture all Lambda functions are event consumers, because they are invoked by an event and they have the responsibility to process it.
An event comes to life, for example, whenever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new item is created on an Amazon DynamoDB table;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a file is deleted on an Amazon S3 bucket;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an Amazon API Gateway is called;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;et cetera&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but we can also use AWS SDK to invoke a function directly on a mobile or web app back-end.
This is a good way to write application logic without designing and maintaining a centralized workflow.
More about event-driven programming &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;zero-administration&#34;&gt;Zero administration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the work you usually need to do in order to assure that your application works in a scalable, reliable and durable way is taken care by the service itself.  Behind the scenes the system performs all the needed administration for the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, code and security patch deployment, code monitoring and logging, and automatically matches the incoming rate of functions invocation for us, to assure capacity provisioning and automatic scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lambda-functions&#34;&gt;Lambda functions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code we run on AWS Lambda is called a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;lambda function&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;. The name &amp;ldquo;lambda&amp;rdquo; derives from the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet. In general a &lt;em&gt;lambda&lt;/em&gt;, also called &lt;em&gt;anonymous function&lt;/em&gt;, is a function that&amp;rsquo;s defined inline (sometimes called &lt;em&gt;closure&lt;/em&gt;) and passed to some other function, method or procedure, to be stored or executed: the &lt;em&gt;anonymity&lt;/em&gt; is given by the fact that we don&amp;rsquo;t give a name to the function, but we just define it at the moment of need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;supported-languages&#34;&gt;Supported languages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now Lambda functions natively support code written in &lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Node.js&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;, but we can run C, Go and PHP using a Node.js wrapper. Hopefully Amazon will add official support for other languages such as PHP, Go, C, Swift and many more. We can also include libraries, even native ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stateless-code&#34;&gt;Stateless code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we write a function our code must be &lt;strong&gt;stateless&lt;/strong&gt;, thus everything begins and ends in the same request, and any persistent state is stored in a storage service (not necessarily within Amazon world). Keeping functions stateless is the keystone to enable the system to instantly launch new instances when needed, to serve the incoming events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the code, each Lambda function has many configuration informations, such as name, description, runtime, handler, memory, max execution time and execution role. A detailed explanation is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction-function.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;invocation-types&#34;&gt;Invocation types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can invoke a Lambda function directly, for example using the Invoke API, or indirectly, for example using the Amazon API Gateway. A function invocation needs to specify the &lt;code&gt;InvocationType&lt;/code&gt;. There are three invocation types allowed: &lt;code&gt;RequestResponse&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DryRun&lt;/code&gt;. Each one of them has different purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;RequestResponse&lt;/code&gt;: in this case we expect a &lt;strong&gt;synchronous&lt;/strong&gt; behavior. The function receives input parameters as an event, and returns a result;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt;: in this case we expect an &lt;strong&gt;asynchronous&lt;/strong&gt; behavior. The function receives input parameters as an event, returns immediately no value, but continues its execution asynchronously;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DryRun&lt;/code&gt;: it&amp;rsquo;s used to verify the access to a function without running it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/event-driven-serverless-applications/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-behaviour.png&#34; alt=&#34;Synchronous vs asynchronous behaviour&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lambda-alternatives&#34;&gt;Lambda alternatives&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serverless is a new cloud computing trend, and accordingly many cloud providers – in addition to Amazon - started offering their own &lt;em&gt;Function as a Service&lt;/em&gt; (FaaS), for example &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; with its &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/functions/&#34;&gt;Cloud Functions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;IBM&lt;/strong&gt; with its &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.ibm.com/openwhisk/&#34;&gt;OpenWhisk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Auth0&lt;/strong&gt; with its &lt;a href=&#34;https://webtask.io/&#34;&gt;WebTasks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; with its &lt;a href=&#34;https://functions.azure.com/&#34;&gt;Azure Functions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions are very useful when we want to build lightweight applications based on &lt;em&gt;microservices&lt;/em&gt; with no server. Their approach could be considered a way to achieve fine-grained microservices, in which there is a relation one-to-one between functions and endpoints instead of one service per one resource: for this reason they are often referred to as &lt;em&gt;nanoservices&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could help developers in focusing on the code, while only charging for code really running in an infrastructure that&amp;rsquo;s able to autonomously grow upon demand, without lots of efforts in managing it. With functions, we can see our code as a series of small and independent building blocks, that can be easily replaced or connected with other blocks using events. Also, Lamba could help small team in reusing existing skills while adopting different languages, in order to develop software that better matches business&amp;rsquo; requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How PHP 7 &amp; TDD helped me sleep better</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-enemies-of-programming&#34;&gt;The enemies of programming&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you will agree with me, &lt;strong&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/strong&gt; is the enemy of programming.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe we fear only one thing more than that: &lt;strong&gt;being interrupted&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/how-php-7-tdd-helped-me-sleep-better/interruption.png&#34; alt=&#34;Why you shouldn&#39;t interrupt a programmer (by Jason Heeris)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing code we have to think really hard, we use complex abstractions, we go through long business workflows and so on&amp;hellip; fatigue and interruptions are the main enemies of those in this line of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-experience&#34;&gt;My experience&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my day job, I do all this mental juggling on a pretty big project, which is based on PHP 5.5, Symfony 2.8, Doctrine etc.; luckily, in this project we use a good deal of &lt;strong&gt;good practices&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;automated software testing&lt;/strong&gt; is one of those. I actually switched to this job to learn about doing automatic testing, continuous integration and other best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost half a year ago &lt;strong&gt;I became a dad&lt;/strong&gt;. It has been great, and you also get some unexpected perks! For example, my colleagues got me this gift for my son:
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/how-php-7-tdd-helped-me-sleep-better/blue-elephpant.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A blue elePHPant!&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we can say that his future is pretty clear&amp;hellip; But don&amp;rsquo;t say this to my wife!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pregnancy, many of my friends and fellow parents warned me half jokingly about one thing: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;sleep now, you&amp;rsquo;ll be deadly tired after!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Now I can say that they were a bit exaggerating, but I can&amp;rsquo;t deny that, having a child takes a toll on your sleep schedule&amp;hellip; Even if, as in my case having a 9 to 6 office job, my wonderful wife does all the parenting heavy lifting (and I consider myself pretty lucky for having her!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months after my son was born I also had the opportunity to start &lt;strong&gt;a new, fresh project&lt;/strong&gt;. To be completely honest, it was not actually fresh: it was a &lt;strong&gt;complete rewrite&lt;/strong&gt; of an internal service that&amp;rsquo;s used to manage the invoices for multiple business units inside our company. I knew pretty well that the old system had to be replaced, so I was put in charge of redoing it from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the issue with the old system (and the main reason behind the rewrite) was &lt;strong&gt;maintainability&lt;/strong&gt;: we had no tests, we had no proper development environment, and its design wasn&amp;rsquo;t that great; also, bureaucracy and invoicing are the core domain of the system, so it was inherently complex. It was the perfect environment to witness the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory&#34;&gt;broken windows theory&lt;/a&gt; in action: the code base got worse over time, one patch, copy paste or quick fix at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, as anyone that&amp;rsquo;s passionate in technology would do, I took the opportunity to use a lot of new shiny tools: I picked &lt;strong&gt;PHP 7&lt;/strong&gt;, which had just been released, and started the project with something familiar to me but still pretty new and cool, &lt;strong&gt;Symfony 3.0&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-i-found-to-be-useful&#34;&gt;What I found to be useful&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rambled and thought about this project a lot in the past months with my colleagues, because the old system was costing us a lot of overhead in usage and maintenance, and we had a pretty clear idea of what its problems were, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to study a lot before starting to write the first classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I had to spend &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; time thinking about an object oriented design for my project, but I was rapidly able to start writing code with confidence. In the end, most of this confidence came from a few choices that I pursued during the development of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tdd-and-high-coverage&#34;&gt;TDD and high coverage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first choice that I am pretty satisfied about is &lt;strong&gt;automatic testing&lt;/strong&gt;: I already knew the advantages of doing tests and Test Driven Development, but in the previous project that practice was not introduced from the start, so not all the codebase was covered, and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t (or wouldn&amp;rsquo;t?) do TDD 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case instead &lt;strong&gt;I wanted to write nearly everything with TDD&lt;/strong&gt;, and keep a &lt;strong&gt;very high threshold for the minimum coverage&lt;/strong&gt; achieved through automatic testing. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on a ~92% test coverage, and I feel proud about it. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a mere &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s hit 100%!&amp;rdquo; mindless goal (&lt;a href=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/blog/ita/software-testing-coverage-vs-efficacia/&#34;&gt;since it&amp;rsquo;s pointless&lt;/a&gt;), but it fueled &lt;strong&gt;a positive feedback cycle&lt;/strong&gt; instead: the more I used TDD in writing new classes, the more the coverage rose and stayed high; at the same time, I found myself inspecting the coverage reports to find missing spots, and that allowed me to discover many edge-cases that I didn&amp;rsquo;t test and should have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I still left some parts without coverage or specific tests, since it was pointless to test them (e.g. Doctrine entities), while I covered some parts multiple times, since they were &lt;strong&gt;critical paths&lt;/strong&gt; inside my application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unit-tests-to-the-rescue&#34;&gt;Unit tests to the rescue!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the main critical advantage that TDD gave me was &lt;strong&gt;focus even on strained days&lt;/strong&gt;: I wrote the classes starting from unit tests, giving all my effort to one piece of code at a time, without having to keep in mind the entire project with its complexities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then wrote some functional tests to assure that the &lt;strong&gt;collaboration between my unit-tested objects&lt;/strong&gt; was fine, and this later step was also useful in delaying the definition of the classes as services inside the Symfony DI container. I was also &lt;strong&gt;able to change my mind&lt;/strong&gt; a few times on some details of the design without having to suffer mental confusion or rewrite too much code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;php-7-scalar-and-return-types-declarations&#34;&gt;PHP 7: scalar and return types declarations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second good choice was &lt;strong&gt;PHP 7&lt;/strong&gt;: among the reasons behind it as the language version of choice for this project were the &lt;a href=&#34;http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php&#34;&gt;two main new features&lt;/a&gt; introduced: &lt;strong&gt;scalar types&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;return type declarations&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/how-php-7-tdd-helped-me-sleep-better/return-types-everywhere-meme.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Return types, return types everywhere!&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Facile.it, I worked as C++ developer, and oh boy! did I miss scalars and return types!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I came onboard of the PHP community right on time&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, I thought&amp;hellip; So I took advantage of the situation to start using all these new features. I enjoyed having again the possibility to typehint strings and integers; I discovered how return types declaration enforces the cohesion of your objects really well, making it &lt;strong&gt;rightly painful to return different things&lt;/strong&gt;: it became impossible to return &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; OR &lt;em&gt;null&lt;/em&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in my tests I found myself writing a lot of this kind of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$result = $testClass-&amp;gt;method();
$this-&amp;gt;assertInstanceOf(SomeClass::class, $result);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did this more than once, just to realize that I was wasting my time! This was normally the first TDD step on PHP 5.x code, but now this kinds of assertion were futile, because the return type was already checked at a language level! Great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return types also proved themselves to be a &lt;strong&gt;double-edged sword&lt;/strong&gt; in some cases, especially on Doctrine entities: they are really useful to enforce consistency in your values, since they trigger a &lt;code&gt;\TypeError&lt;/code&gt; each time you call a getter method on a erroneously empty property, but &lt;strong&gt;you can&amp;rsquo;t use them on nullable fields&lt;/strong&gt;, since it will break your application at any time during execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, having return types declared on your business-logic classes it&amp;rsquo;s pretty useful, even more when used in conjunction with TDD: every time you define a mock you are forced to declare expectations and predictions with the right types, so it &lt;strong&gt;indirectly helps maintaining the collaboration contract between objects&lt;/strong&gt;, without too much hassle. If I changed a method&amp;rsquo;s signature that was mocked somewhere, the mock would break the test, &lt;strong&gt;highlighting the issue and making the tests&lt;/strong&gt; (and an high coverage) &lt;strong&gt;even more valuable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, these and other &lt;strong&gt;good practices are helpful&lt;/strong&gt; for both your job and your personal life: you can go a long way in being fit and in the best shape while working, but stressful and (good) distracting events are unavoidable: you&amp;rsquo;ll often have to fight stress, fatigue or distractions, and there will be days where you can&amp;rsquo;t be at the top of your game, for any number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since programming is a mental job, I think that having instruments and good practices in your toolset is invaluable, being them the &lt;strong&gt;essential tools of our craft&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, I hope that those little life/programming lessons I learned in these months will be useful to other people like me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facile.it devs @ PhpDay 2016</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/php-day-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Almost like a nice tradition, we went to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2016.phpday.it/&#34;&gt;PHP Day conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; this year as well; this time too it was held in Verona, on &lt;strong&gt;May 13th and 14th&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We participated and attended numerous talks and, &lt;a href=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/blog/ita/php-day-2015/&#34;&gt;as last year&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted to write a light summary; this won&amp;rsquo;t be a full &amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo;, but our intent instead is to highlight what captured our interest most, or what we found more valuable for our everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, we hope to give a brief glimpse of what we experienced to fellow developers that hadn&amp;rsquo;t the opportunity to attend, and to tempt some of you to join conferences like this one or those in the PHP community at large, for your personal and professional growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talks are in chronological order, and we linked the slides when available. Enjoy your reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;technical-talks&#34;&gt;Technical Talks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-api-is-a-ui&#34;&gt;Your API is a UI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christopher Hoult (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/choult&#34;&gt;@choult&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - 11:00 – 12:00 - track 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting and very smooth talk. It stayed pretty general with nice advices about &lt;strong&gt;API development&lt;/strong&gt;, but showed some reasoning about a pyramidal &amp;ldquo;scheme of priorities&amp;rdquo; that we should follow, deriving from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&#34;&gt;Maslow&amp;rsquo;s hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dip-your-toes-in-the-sea-of-security&#34;&gt;Dip Your Toes in the Sea of Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James Titcumb (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/asgrim&#34;&gt;@asgrim&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - 14:30 – 15:30 - track 1 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/asgrim1/dip-your-toes-in-the-sea-of-security-phpday-2016&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we saw an interesting overview of &lt;strong&gt;security issues&lt;/strong&gt; that a web application can encounter. It ranged from basic SQL injection, to timing attacks (that were explained pretty well!), to CSRF protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-regular-expressions&#34;&gt;How I learned to stop worrying and love Regular Expressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jordi Boggiano (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/seldaek&#34;&gt;@seldaek&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - 15:30 – 16:30 - track 1 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://slides.seld.be/?file=2016-05-13+How+I+learned+to+stop+worrying+and+love+Regular+Expressions.html&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we went from basic &lt;strong&gt;regular expressions&lt;/strong&gt;, to basic pattern recognition, to advanced usage; the speaker took also the time to explain to us how the regex engine works, through thorough examples of pattern matching advancement and backtracking. Also, bonus points for the slides! They were pretty neat, and everything was themed to the &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;/em&gt; movie, from images to phrases used in the examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dockerizing-your-php-ci-pipelines&#34;&gt;Dockerizing your PHP CI Pipelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul Dragoonis (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/dr4goonis&#34;&gt;@dr4goonis&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - 17:00 – 17:30 - track 2 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://dragoonis.com/talks/phpday-may-2016/#/&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was about &lt;strong&gt;using Jenkins with Docker&lt;/strong&gt; and having optimized pipelines for fast builds and short commit-to-deploy times. It should have been a 1-hour-long talk, so the speaker had to cut short on a lot of things, but I took a lot of useful advice from it nonetheless. Fortunately, he was kind enough to give the extra bits of his talk in the unconference track the day after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;drinking-beer-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-php&#34;&gt;Drinking Beer with a Raspberry Pi and PHP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew Carter (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/AndrewCarterUK&#34;&gt;@AndrewCarterUK&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2 - 15:30 – 16:30 - track 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was uncommon but really funny. The speaker explained that programming the Raspberry Pi is possible even with PHP! He showed us a working example of an AaaS (Alcohol as a Service) machine. It was a simple tool with a liquid pump and a flow detector that is used to fill up glasses with any kind of drink. It can be activated via API as any regular service. The speaker also explained how it is possible to communicate with external devices via the powerful IO pins using Unix device files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;evolution-of-web-application-architecture&#34;&gt;Evolution of Web Application Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kore Nordmann (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/koredn&#34;&gt;@koredn&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2 - 15:30 – 16:30 - track 2 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://qafoo.com/resources/presentations/phpday_2016_2016/evolution_of_web_application_architecture.html&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk covered the &lt;strong&gt;evolution of the technological stack&lt;/strong&gt; behind a normal web application, from single-server to multi-server architecture. Each addition to the stack was discussed and weighted, without taking for granted any single step: from adding a master-slave database configuration, to caching session and\or query results. This gave us a pretty clear idea of &lt;strong&gt;when and why&lt;/strong&gt; such steps should be taken while adding new functionalities to a project, or overcoming technical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-functional-in-php&#34;&gt;Being functional in PHP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David de Boer (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ddeboer_nl&#34;&gt;@ddeboer_nl&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2 - 16:30 – 17:00 - track 1 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/boerdedavid/being-functional-in-php-php-day-italy-2016&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was an &lt;strong&gt;introduction to functional programming&lt;/strong&gt;. The speaker compared highly declarative languages such as Erlang with PHP. He demonstrated the options we have to adopt functional programming in PHP. Basic concepts were covered in a clear and simple way: mapping, reduction, function composition and higher-order functions. Particular focus was given to the use of pure functions and their main advantage: the absence of side effects. Finally, the speaker went through an interesting comparison between OOP and functional programming, showing their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;keynotes&#34;&gt;Keynotes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploying-php-7&#34;&gt;Deploying PHP 7&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rasmus Lerdorf (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/rasmus&#34;&gt;@rasmus&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - 09:45 – 10:45 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://talks.php.net/phpday16#/&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rasmus is a veteran at PHPDay, and he gives opening keynotes here almost every two years. This year&amp;rsquo;s was obviously about PHP 7, and it was more a technical talk than else. It went from &lt;strong&gt;benchmark data&lt;/strong&gt; to technical tips on how to smooth the transition to this new major version of PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-badoo-saved-1m-switching-to-php7&#34;&gt;How Badoo Saved $1M Switching to PHP7&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikolay Krapivnyy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2 - 09:45 – 10:45 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/216377/verona_php_2.pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://techblog.badoo.com/blog/2016/03/14/how-badoo-saved-one-million-dollars-switching-to-php7/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about this technological switch made the rounds on a lot on PHP-related websites some months ago; this talk was very technical too, and it showed us how big is Badoo&amp;rsquo;s technological stack, with 3000 servers, 1000 of which running PHP. It gave us a nice overview of the &lt;strong&gt;technical challenges&lt;/strong&gt; that their tech team endured to do this upgrade, and how it gave them the possibility to save more than a half of their hardware resources; also&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Faster Web with HTTP/2</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/faster-web-with-http-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/faster-web-with-http-2/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;HTTP is the protocol that powers the Web. It was originally designed in 1996 for transferring and manipulating simple text-based documents (mainly hypertext resources).
Nowadays it&amp;rsquo;s been adopted for many different purposes. It&amp;rsquo;s used for: multimedia content transfer, rich real-time session-based web applications, API messages dispatch, Internet of Things and much more.
For this reason, the HTTP specifications are continuously updated, by adding new features and improving performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2015, the latest version 2.0 was standardized with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540&#34;&gt;RFC 7540&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
This introduced major differences on how the low-level protocol works.
From the application perspective, very little has changed: requests, responses, resources, headers and HTTP methods are still there.
New features have been added such as the possibility to &lt;strong&gt;push resources to the client&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason that led to HTTP/2 is &lt;strong&gt;improving performance&lt;/strong&gt;.
Previous versions of HTTP had critical problems that were not addressable without changing the low-level communication mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;http-1-1-issues&#34;&gt;HTTP/1.1 issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/2 deals with many of the performance issues of HTTP/1.1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP/1.1 doesn&amp;rsquo;t support headers compression even though it would be particularly effective against text-based data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP/1.1 &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining&#34;&gt;request pipelining&lt;/a&gt; is not so efficient due to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking&#34;&gt;head-of-line blocking&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern web applications have complex resources that are linked to each other. HTTP/1.1 servers have no way to send all the related resources at once in order to avoid additional round-trips;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP/1.1 connections are designed to have short lifespans. Unfortunately, web resources change over time and additional connections are required to fetch the updated data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have adopted several tricks to mitigate these problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session data is usually persisted on the server to minimize the amount of headers sent at every request;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reduce latency and to achieve request multiplexing, browsers open several TCP connections during page load. This is not recommended: it consumes many more resources (both client-side and server-side) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control&#34;&gt;TCP congestion avoidance&lt;/a&gt; techniques are no longer effective;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent web applications prefer leaving connections open to reduce connection setup latency for subsequent requests;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-changed&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s changed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/2 is &lt;strong&gt;no longer text-based&lt;/strong&gt;; this means debugging could be somewhat difficult without using special tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Server and client communicate by sending small binary messages named &lt;strong&gt;Frames&lt;/strong&gt;.
There are different types of frames. The most important ones are &lt;code&gt;DATA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HEADERS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SETTINGS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PUSH_PROMISE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/2 uses the concept of &lt;strong&gt;streams&lt;/strong&gt;. Each stream is identified by an ID and it&amp;rsquo;s allocated for every request/response lifecycle.
Several streams can be active at the same time on the same connection: this provides &lt;strong&gt;real request pipelining and multiplexing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each frame contains the ID of the stream they refer to. Thus, frames of different streams can be interleaved without interfering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servers, by sending the &lt;code&gt;PUSH_PROMISE&lt;/code&gt; frame, can allocate new streams without waiting for an explicit request from the client. By the virtue of this, &lt;strong&gt;the server can push resources to the client&lt;/strong&gt; and reduce the number of round-trip messages needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Http headers (both requests&amp;rsquo; and responses&amp;rsquo; ones) are always compressed and they are sent using one or more &lt;code&gt;HEADERS&lt;/code&gt; frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6.1&#34;&gt;Response Status-Line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5.1&#34;&gt;request Request-Line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; have been moved. They are now stored in the header section via special headers (pseudo-headers): &lt;code&gt;:method&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:path&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:status&lt;/code&gt;, etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Response Status-Line Reason-Phrase&lt;/em&gt; has been completely removed: there is no equivalent in HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servers and clients may use &lt;code&gt;PING&lt;/code&gt; frames to check the underlying connection&amp;rsquo;s state and to keep the connection alive even for a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;support-by-servers-and-user-agents&#34;&gt;Support by servers and user agents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/2 is actually a fork of &lt;a href=&#34;http://dev.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper&#34;&gt;SPDY&lt;/a&gt;, a protocol developed by Google.
A lot of different servers and clients already supported the SPDY protocol, so the transition from SPDY to HTTP/2 was pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/2 was officially released in May 2015; since then &lt;strong&gt;all major web servers have added support for HTTP/2&lt;/strong&gt; such as Apache HTTP, Apache Tomcat, Nginx, IIS and Jetty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All major browsers now support HTTP/2&lt;/strong&gt;, e.g. Firefox, Chrome, IE and Edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A the moment, they only allow HTTP/2 over TLS via &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301&#34;&gt;ALPN&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-agl-tls-nextprotoneg-04&#34;&gt;NPN&lt;/a&gt; as Protocol Negotiation mechanisms.
RFC 7540 considers the case of HTTP/2 being used on cleartext connections as well, but actually this is not extensively used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;additional-resources&#34;&gt;Additional resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.http2demo.io/&#34;&gt;Http2demo.io&lt;/a&gt; compares performance metrics between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about HTTP/2, you can read the official specifications (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540&#34;&gt;RFC 7540&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) or download the book &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://daniel.haxx.se/http2/&#34;&gt;Http2 explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which also examines the reasons behind HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog restyling: switching to Hugo and GitHub Pages</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, we went through a bit of a restyling in the last few days, and our blog changed a lot in terms of appearance and structure.
We are very happy with those changes, but the reason behind this transition is not just a simple template change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-we-were-searching-for&#34;&gt;What we were searching for&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before, we were using an hosted CMS to run the blog, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghost.org/&#34;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. We were happy with the results, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t our concern to administrate the server or bother about other hosting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as many other developers, we were &lt;strong&gt;hitching for something&lt;/strong&gt; more aligned with our inclinations: we wanted a tool that was closer to our daily jobs and our skills. We were also having &lt;strong&gt;problems during the revision phase&lt;/strong&gt; of the articles, since multiple persons couldn&amp;rsquo;t review and edit an article at the same time, fearing the risk of overwriting each other&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then came down with a list of requirements for our blog; we wanted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy review of articles&lt;/strong&gt;: parallels reviews are a must&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;an easy workflow&lt;/strong&gt;: no major overhead, since the blog contributions are voluntary amongs us; we want to dedicate all the time to writing the articles, not wrestling with technical difficulties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no security flaws&lt;/strong&gt;: this point disqualified Wordpress and other famous CMS solutions; we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like to spend time staying ahead of possible security risks, or have to worry over the hosting and installation problems that a widespread used CMS has&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy image hosting&lt;/strong&gt; and embedding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy management and modifications of the &lt;strong&gt;template&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy integrations of previously used &lt;a href=&#34;https://disqus.com/&#34;&gt;Disqus comments&lt;/a&gt; and Google Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;preferably &lt;strong&gt;markdown content format&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for &lt;strong&gt;multilanguage articles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;git-and-the-github-pages&#34;&gt;Git and the GitHub pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first solution that came to us was obviously &lt;strong&gt;Git&lt;/strong&gt;, the everyday tool for a team of developers working on the same piece of code (or text, in this case). We obviously then thought of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt; as an hosting solution: that is ideal, since we already have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/facile-it&#34;&gt;Github organization&lt;/a&gt; in place, so an organization homepage/site would perfectly fit the bill for our blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we set our eyes to that hosting solution, we started to search for a solution for building our blog. The proposed solution was &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;: it&amp;rsquo;s a static site generator, developed in Go, which fitted almost all of our requisites; also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it generates the static HMTL site live, with a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/extras/livereload/&#34;&gt;live reload&lt;/a&gt; functionality&lt;/strong&gt;: while you edit your markdown article, the site refresh itself on each save of the file(s), so you can see a live preview of what you&amp;rsquo;re writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are many templates ready to be used, and we &lt;a href=&#34;http://themes.gohugo.io/future-imperfect/&#34;&gt;chose one&lt;/a&gt; to be modified to our needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the templates are built with the Go Templating engine, and with some easy manual edits we obtained all the requested features: multi-author support, link between translated articles, recent articles and top categories in the sidebar&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploying&#34;&gt;Deploying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step needed to smooth out our workflow was to find a &lt;strong&gt;deploy strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. Github pages need to have the site content published onto the master branch, and we obviously wanted to separate the source code of the site from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed an easy way to reproduce this steps, ideally with a script commited to the repo, ready for everyone to use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;generate&lt;/strong&gt; the static site with Hugo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;avoid mixing (and committing)&lt;/strong&gt; the static copy with the source files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commit the files to the master branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo normally generates the static copy in the &lt;code&gt;./public&lt;/code&gt; directory; to achieve this we used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy&#34;&gt;a script that I found on GitHub itself&lt;/a&gt; that solved this exact problem. We started an empty &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; branch, &lt;strong&gt;detached&lt;/strong&gt; from master:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout -b source --orphan
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our Hugo site inside it, and we put the &lt;code&gt;./public&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;.gitIgnore&lt;/code&gt;, so each static generation would not be committed. We then prepared the deploy script that, after generating the static site, uses a Git subtree approach to commit its content to the master branch, with a commit message of &lt;code&gt;publish: &amp;lt;last commit message from source&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;et-voilà-here-we-are&#34;&gt;Et voilà, here we are!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we hope that you will enjoy our new blog at least as much as we enjoyed building it ! Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Droidcon It 2016</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/droidcon-it-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/droidcon-it-2016/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/droidconit-recap/logo_droidcon_it.png&#34; alt=&#34;Droidcon It&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third edition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://it.droidcon.com/2016/&#34;&gt;Droidcon IT&lt;/a&gt; was, as expected, a great conference, full of interesting talks and people coming from all over the world. We saw a lot of GDEs (&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/experts/all/technology/android&#34;&gt;Google Developer Expert&lt;/a&gt;) and also some Developer Advocates from Google, although it was not organized directly by the company. Back in March the Android team surprisingly released the brand new &lt;strong&gt;N Developer Preview&lt;/strong&gt; earlier than expected, so this year we were already able to talk about the new features in Android N and analyze them. Furthermore, there was talk of &lt;strong&gt;Kotlin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;RxJava&lt;/strong&gt; and a lot of other useful and interesting topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to recap the event and make some considerations about the most interesting (and funny) talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keynote-wojtek-kalicinski-https-twitter-com-wkalic&#34;&gt;Keynote - &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/wkalic&#34;&gt;Wojtek Kalicinski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day 1 keynote was all about the N Developer Preview and was given by Wojtek Kalicinski, a developer advocate directly from Google.
Wojtek went through all the new improvements of the platform, both from user&amp;rsquo;s and developer&amp;rsquo;s point of view. Here’s a short summary of the most relevant ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-window support&lt;/strong&gt;: probably the most requested user feature. I’ve always thought that its implementation would have been relatively straightforward, given the already responsive UI of Android, and in fact the code changes that are needed to support this feature are minimal. Just make sure you don’t lock screen orientation using &lt;code&gt;android:screenOrientation&lt;/code&gt; in your manifest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better notifications&lt;/strong&gt;: in addition to a visual change of the notification panel, apps will now be able to let the user interact with bundled notifications individually or to reply from the notification itself directly. Moreover, if the app already supports Android Wear notifications, most of this will come for free, since the APIs are the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doze improvements&lt;/strong&gt;: the battery saving mode called Doze, now works — in a less aggressive mode — when the phone is in the user pocket or hands, and not only when the phone is stationary. Wojtek said that most of the apps should continue to work without any change — or eventually &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/intl/ko/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html#assessing_your_app&#34;&gt;minimal&lt;/a&gt; —, but he strongly encouraged to test apps against this new feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAVA 8 features!&lt;/strong&gt;: finally Google will allow developers to use a limited set of features from the latest version of the language (already two years old) including &lt;em&gt;lambdas&lt;/em&gt; (🎉) and &lt;em&gt;default and static interface methods&lt;/em&gt; (TODO: add DP2 apis). All of this is possibile thanks to the Jack&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; toolchain which is able to compile Java 8 syntax to Java 6 compatible bytecode: in this way, old phones’ support is guaranteed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other changes include improvements to &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/intl/ko/preview/api-overview.html#background_optimizations&#34;&gt;Project Svelte&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/intl/ko/preview/api-overview.html#data_saver&#34;&gt;Data Saver&lt;/a&gt; feature, the addition of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/intl/ko/preview/api-overview.html#tile_api&#34;&gt;Quick Settings Tile API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/intl/ko/preview/api-overview.html&#34;&gt;many more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting and encouraging aspect coming out from the keynote and the N Preview release itself, is the fact that Google is, finally, trying to fix the Android updates issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/droidconit-recap/n-preview-updates.png&#34; alt=&#34;N Preview Updates&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only the release of the new OS preview six months before its public release — instead of three — is really useful for third party developers to update apps to support new APIs, but hopefully it will also help phone manufactures to keep their custom Android implementations more aligned with the stock version release cycle. This will result in a better user experience and, more importantly to us, a better developer experience, making it closer to the iOS world where developers are not required to support five years old OS versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;perfmatters-for-android-hasan-hosgel-https-twitter-com-alosdev&#34;&gt;#PERFMATTERS for Android - &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alosdev&#34;&gt;Hasan Hosgel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/alosdev/perfmatters-for-android-droidcon-turin-2016&#34;&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk was all about performance in Android. The speaker analyzed why #&lt;strong&gt;PERFMATTERS&lt;/strong&gt; on Android: the typical mobile user is generally &lt;em&gt;impatient&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;intolerant&lt;/em&gt; and even just a couple of extra seconds during the start-up could make the difference in the user&amp;rsquo;s choice to use or not your app. Hasan went through a lot of interesting tips and tricks to improve performance, such as avoiding multi-pass nested layout — a topic discussed in more detail by Huyen Tue Dao during her &lt;a href=&#34;#lean-layouts&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; —, avoiding memory leaks or having a cache on disk for data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance is crucial to &lt;strong&gt;engage the user&lt;/strong&gt; and I think the speaker did a great job in summarizing useful tips to improve it. Moreover most of them doesn’t alter the readability or the maintainability of the code, as is often the case for performance driven code changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-it-flow-unidirectional-data-flow-architecture-in-android-benjamin-augustin-https-twitter-com-dorvaryn&#34;&gt;Let it flow! Unidirectional data flow architecture in Android - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dorvaryn&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benjamin Augustin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/dorvaryn/let-it-flow&#34;&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of patterns to structure the presentation layer (UI) in Android is still infrequent. During the last couple of years we have seen a lot of discussions about &lt;strong&gt;MVC&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;MVP&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;MVVM&lt;/strong&gt; patterns within the Android developers community, and some implementations of them.
During the talk the speaker presented a new approach that takes some concepts from the web development world like &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/flux/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://redux.js.org&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The concept in a nutshell is that the UI, in addition to being as dumb as possible, should also be &lt;strong&gt;stateless&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, the UI listens to state changes pushed by the business logic and updates itself accordingly.
Benjamin chose to focus more on the practical aspects and so he made the concept clear by directly building an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Dorvaryn/unidirectionalDataFlow&#34;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; using Kotlin and RxJava.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally likey approach that Benjamin showed us, since it has a lot of advantages. It makes the UI state completely &lt;strong&gt;predictable&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;reproducible&lt;/strong&gt;: it allows us to represent an app state without the need to go through all the steps needed to reach it, thus it can be very useful in reproducing a bug or testing a particular situation. The problem is that, as you can see from the demo app, it adds a lot of boilerplate code and it&amp;rsquo;s also much more verbose and difficult to implement without tools like RxJava or Kotlin, that might be problematic to some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;play-everywhere-providing-a-consistent-experience-across-very-different-devices-alessandro-bizzarri-http-it-droidcon-com-2016-speakers-alessandro-bizzarri-dima-kunin-http-it-droidcon-com-2016-speakers-dima-kunin&#34;&gt;Play everywhere: providing a consistent experience across very different devices - &lt;a href=&#34;http://it.droidcon.com/2016/speakers/alessandro-bizzarri/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alessandro Bizzarri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://it.droidcon.com/2016/speakers/dima-kunin/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dima Kunin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two speakers showed a high-level tour of how at &lt;strong&gt;Spotify&lt;/strong&gt; they  are able to provide a consistent experience across different devices — defined as the combination of its physical form and its OS.
They created their own &lt;strong&gt;design language&lt;/strong&gt; to support the majority of platforms used to define almost everything, from color palette and buttons style to animations and sounds.
They explained also how they use a &lt;strong&gt;C++ library&lt;/strong&gt; common to all platforms to reuse code; in particular on Android they use it through the NDK, a toolset to include C or C++ code in your app and call it from Java code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a light talk but still it was interesting to see how a big company like Spotify finds solutions to scale and maintain a &lt;strong&gt;consistent and engaging UX&lt;/strong&gt; across all of its user-base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;loving-lean-layouts-huyen-tue-dao-https-twitter-com-queencodemonkey-a-name-lean-layouts-a&#34;&gt;Loving lean layouts - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/queencodemonkey&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huyen Tue Dao&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&#34;lean-layouts&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/queencodemonkey/droidcon-italy-2016-loving-lean-layouts&#34;&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker gave a really great talk about one of the best ways to keep an app smooth and responsive: &lt;strong&gt;optimize layouts&lt;/strong&gt; to be as flat as possible. The Android UI layer will call &lt;code&gt;measure()&lt;/code&gt; and    &lt;code&gt;layout()&lt;/code&gt; methods — two times in the case of &lt;code&gt;RelativeLayout&lt;/code&gt; — through all the hierarchy of views to be able to draw the layout; so, for example, having a useless root level  or useless views will result in more measure/layout passes, thus poor performance. Huyen explained how sometimes the solution to this problem may be to choose the right view or layout, but it could be useful to know that there is always the possibility to implement a custom &lt;code&gt;ViewGroup&lt;/code&gt; to mitigate the number of measure/layout passes or even a totally custom &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt; that overrides &lt;code&gt;onDraw()&lt;/code&gt; to draw everything by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk was very easy to follow and really useful: most of the advices covered are often ignored because singularly they have less impact, but, if taken all together and especially as good habits, they could really make the difference in maintain the &lt;strong&gt;UI smooth and lag-free&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;android-reactive-programming-with-rxjava-ivan-morgillo-https-twitter-com-hamen&#34;&gt;Android reactive programming with RxJava - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hamen&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ivan Morgillo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During last couple of years RxJava has been echoing all over the Android developers community and given its huge popularity I was surprised to see that Droidcon IT offered only one talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately Ivan Morgillo is a topic expert — he also wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/rxjava-essentials&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about RxJava and Android — and during the talk he went through some of the &lt;strong&gt;basics of reactive programming&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;code&gt;Observables&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Observer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Subscription&lt;/code&gt;…) and a lot of useful &lt;strong&gt;operators&lt;/strong&gt;, which are one of the strengths of RxJava and Reactive extensions (Rx*) in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I was hoping for a more theoretical talk with an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of embracing the reactive pattern in our Android projects. It was instead a lot practical and it covered a great number of common use cases where reactive programming could really help to make code mode readable and maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-can-do-better-with-kotlin-svetlana-isakova-https-github-com-svtk&#34;&gt;You can do better with Kotlin - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/svtk&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Svetlana Isakova&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/svtk/you-can-do-better-with-kotlin&#34;&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin has recently reached &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/02/kotlin-1-0-released-pragmatic-language-for-jvm-and-android/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.0 version&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it is gaining a lot of attention within the Java community and especially the Android one. A lot of developers — me included — are in fact hoping that Google will make it the default programming language for its mobile OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin is a &lt;strong&gt;modern&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;pragmatic&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Android-friendly&lt;/strong&gt; programming language, with robust supporting tools since it is developed from the people behind IntelliJ (thus, Android Studio). It could be mixed with Java code — thus making the switch painless — since there is no Kotlin SDK but just JDK plus extensions, and it includes a lot of modern concept such as &lt;em&gt;data classes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;null-safety&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;extension functions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;lambdas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker showed also ANKO, a DSL written in Kotlin, that uses &lt;em&gt;lambdas with receivers&lt;/em&gt;, to create layouts and views and allows to write code like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;verticalLayout {
    val name = editText()
    button(&amp;quot;Say Hello&amp;quot;) {
        onClick { toast(&amp;quot;Hello, ${name.text}!&amp;quot;) }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was one of the most interesting to me, as it persuaded me to try and deepen my knowledge of Kotlin. Svetlana was very good at showing the main features of the JetBrains language and at explaining how they convert in Java code, an aspect that I found very useful to mutate my mindset with new concepts and  syntaxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fun-things-you-cando-in-kotlin-maciej-górski-https-github-com-mg6maciej&#34;&gt;fun things (you: CanDo &lt;in Kotlin&gt; ) = … - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mg6maciej&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maciej Górski&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mg6maciej/fun-things-you-CanDo-in-Kotlin&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second Droidcon talk about Kotlin was a very fun one, with the speaker acting a funny scene where a nephew tries to explain to his granpa why he should use &lt;strong&gt;Kotlin instead of Java&lt;/strong&gt; with a live coding session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&#39;embed-container&#39;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVu_0TIiH8Q&#39; frameborder=&#39;0&#39; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of the talk was still in live programming (without slides) and showed some Kotlin feature in practice. It covered some advanced topics such as functional programming, operator overloading, infix functions, laziness and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was funny and informative to watch a &lt;strong&gt;live coding talk&lt;/strong&gt; and for sure it made me more curious and confident about Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Droidcon IT is already, after three editions, the &lt;strong&gt;point of reference&lt;/strong&gt; for the Android community in Italy and this year too it lived up to the expectations. We saw a lot of well-known speakers and developers such as the Googlers Nick Butcher and  Wojtek Kaliciński. It was a conference rich of interesting talks in addition to those summarized in this post, ranging between al lot of various topics such as TDD, UX, tools and many more. The only thing that surprised me was the lack of talks about Android Wear: perhaps Google is slowing down to push this platform among developers?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/json-web-tokens/logo.svg&#34; alt=&#34;JWT&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my study about JWT, I was searching for a smart method to authenticate a request, without querying the database each time to check the applicant reliability.
I needed a token or something similar with the ability to validate itself and flexible enough to customize the validation strategy.
Imagine for example a web application where a user can login and obtain a &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo; with his name and an expiration time, and this pass will let him ask for resources until the pass expires, and only if the issuer is trusted.
Thanks to JWT&amp;rsquo;s self verification capabilities, I could discard every request where the token is invalid (a fake token not signed by my application) or expired.
Beyond this specific use case, JWT can be also useful to securely transmit data to other applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me introduce the standard: JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519&#34;&gt;RFC 7519&lt;/a&gt; that defines a compact, self-contained and secure way for transmitting information between two parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using javascript object notation to represent the data means two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saving lots of bytes when the token goes over the network, &lt;strong&gt;because of it&amp;rsquo;s size&lt;/strong&gt; it can be sent over an URL or inside an HTTP Header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it can be &lt;strong&gt;easily parsed by a browser&lt;/strong&gt; and consumed by a client application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more clear when comparing JSON to other standards like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language&#34;&gt;SAML&lt;/a&gt; that uses a very verbose XML structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JWT token can be trusted because it is digitally signed using a secret (usually with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code&#34;&gt;HMAC&lt;/a&gt; algorithm) or a keypair with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA&#34;&gt;RSA&lt;/a&gt;.
Its payload contains all the required data to verify itself and, for example, transport the user data to avoid querying the database more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-the-token-presents-itself&#34;&gt;How the token presents itself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A token is represented as three base64 encoded strings joined by two points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;headers&#34;&gt;Headers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the string contains the headers, &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;alg&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; is the algorithm used to secure the token and &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;typ&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; is the type; in this case as we can see that I used an HMAC SHA256 to sign the JWT token:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;alg&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;HS256&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;typ&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;JWT&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;payload&#34;&gt;Payload&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part is the payload: it&amp;rsquo;s the data sent with the token. It contains metadata and information like expiration, audience or subject, and whatever you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;sub&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1234567890&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;John Doe&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;admin&amp;quot;: true
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All data is organized in &lt;strong&gt;claims&lt;/strong&gt;, statements about an entity (typically, the user). There are three types of claims: reserved, public, and private claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reserved claims&lt;/strong&gt;: a set of predefined claims, conceived to provide a set of useful information. Some of them are: &lt;code&gt;iss&lt;/code&gt; (issuer), &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; (expiration time), &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt; (subject), &lt;code&gt;aud&lt;/code&gt; (audience), among others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public claims&lt;/strong&gt;: defined at will but, in order to avoid collisions, they should be defined in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml&#34;&gt;IANA JSON Web Token Registry&lt;/a&gt; or be described as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private claims&lt;/strong&gt;: custom claims created to share information between parties that agree with using them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sign&#34;&gt;Sign&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third part of the string is the sign, obtained from hashing headers and payload with a secret using the algorithm described in headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said before the more interesting feature of JWT is in it&amp;rsquo;s flexibility. It can be created with the claims you need, carry your data and validated on other claims (standard or not).
As an example, if on authentication I want to be sure that the token is issued by my application and that it is not older than 1 hour I can generate a token with a payload like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;iss&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1234567890&amp;quot;, // my application code
  &amp;quot;exp&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1459868400&amp;quot;, // 2016-04-04 15:00:00 Expiration time
  &amp;quot;uid&amp;quot;: 159, // the user id
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Alessandro Galli&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once my application receives a request with this token, an authenticator component will check the two claims (&lt;code&gt;iss&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt;) to be sure of the assertions made before, and then validate the sign. Furthermore, with the additional claims it can login the user without querying the database and complete the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach results in a stateless authentication removing all problems related to session storage, CORS+cookies requests and CSRF protection, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a solid standard, JWT has been adopted by a large number of users and it has libraries for almost every programming language: PHP, Java, Go, Python, Javascript, Ruby, Elixir, Scala, .NET. You can find a full list of available and trusted libraries on &lt;a href=&#34;https://jwt.io/#libraries-io&#34;&gt;JWT.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next weeks, I will write a post and release my personal authentication example, using PHP with the Symfony framework.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decoupling view controllers with Signals</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/decoupling-view-controllers-with.signals/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/decoupling-view-controllers-with.signals/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/code-reuse-a-primer/&#34;&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt; we looked at the &lt;strong&gt;Signal&lt;/strong&gt; class, that is, a simple, reusable way of encapsulating the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern&#34;&gt;observer pattern&lt;/a&gt;. There are many use cases for a signal, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to show one possible application, spawned from a real-world problem. View controllers&amp;rsquo; composition and decoupling is &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt;: we often need an input from a view controller, that has to send its input back to its creator, while handling the back navigation somehow. We often find ourselves in a situation in which several different responsibilities are all expressed in a single view controller, with the effect of creating a gigantic class, full of entangled imperative statements, hard-to-understand sequencing and general complexity. We&amp;rsquo;ll use the &lt;code&gt;Signal&lt;/code&gt; class to assign the various responsibilities to different classes, and write cleaner, more declarative code. The core of this architectural pattern lies in inverting the way in which objects communicate, view controller or other: instead of asking objects to do things, we&amp;rsquo;re going to &lt;strong&gt;observe&lt;/strong&gt; what objects are doing, and &lt;strong&gt;react&lt;/strong&gt; accordingly. &lt;em&gt;Observe&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;React&lt;/em&gt; are the cornerstones of the programming paradigm known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming&#34;&gt;functional reactive programming(FRP)&lt;/a&gt;; the present article is not going to talk about FRP as a whole, nor to present shared FRP techniques; the point is to discuss an architectural pattern for decoupling view controllers from responsibilities not strictly related to user interaction, by leveraging some basic FRP tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example project for this article is available in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/broomburgo/SignalViewControllers/&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m going to paste some code examples, but it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to check and test the entire project while reading the article. What follows is the full implementation of &lt;code&gt;Signal&lt;/code&gt;, and its public interface for sending new values, called &lt;code&gt;Emitter&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Swift&#34;&gt;import Foundation

public enum Persistence {
  case Stop
  case Continue
}

public final class Signal&amp;lt;Subtype&amp;gt; {
  typealias Observation = Subtype -&amp;gt; Persistence

  private var observations: [Observation] = []

  public init() {}

  public func onReception (observeFunction: Subtype -&amp;gt; Persistence) -&amp;gt; Signal {
    observations.append(observeFunction)
    return self
  }

  public func map&amp;lt;OtherSubtype&amp;gt;(transform: Subtype -&amp;gt; OtherSubtype) -&amp;gt; Signal&amp;lt;OtherSubtype&amp;gt; {
    let mappedSignal = Signal&amp;lt;OtherSubtype&amp;gt;()
    onReception {
      mappedSignal.send(transform($0))
      return .Continue
    }
    return mappedSignal
  }

  public func flatMap&amp;lt;OtherSubtype&amp;gt;(transform: Subtype -&amp;gt; Signal&amp;lt;OtherSubtype&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; Signal&amp;lt;OtherSubtype&amp;gt; {
    let mappedSignal = Signal&amp;lt;OtherSubtype&amp;gt;()
    onReception {
      transform($0).onReception {
        mappedSignal.send($0)
        return .Continue
      }
      return .Continue
    }
    return mappedSignal
  }

  public func filter(predicate: Subtype -&amp;gt; Bool) -&amp;gt; Signal {
    let filteredSignal = Signal&amp;lt;Subtype&amp;gt;()
    onReception {
      if predicate($0) {
        filteredSignal.send($0)
      }
      return .Continue
    }
    return filteredSignal
  }

  public func unionWith (otherSignal: Signal&amp;lt;Subtype&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; Signal {
    let unifiedSignal = Signal&amp;lt;Subtype&amp;gt;()
    let observeFunction = { (value: Subtype) -&amp;gt; Persistence in
      unifiedSignal.send(value)
      return .Continue
    }
    onReception(observeFunction)
    otherSignal.onReception(observeFunction)
    return unifiedSignal
  }
}

public func + &amp;lt;Subtype&amp;gt; (left: Signal&amp;lt;Subtype&amp;gt;, right: Signal&amp;lt;Subtype&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; Signal&amp;lt;Subtype&amp;gt; {
  return left.unionWith(right)
}

extension Signal {
  private func send (value: Subtype) {
    var newObservations: [Observation] = []
    while observations.count &amp;gt; 0 {
      let observe = observations.removeFirst()
      let persistence = observe(value)
      switch persistence {
      case .Continue:
        newObservations.append(observe)
      case .Stop: break
      }
    }
    observations = newObservations
  }
}

public final class Emitter&amp;lt;Subtype&amp;gt; {
  public let signal = Signal&amp;lt;Subtype&amp;gt;()

  public func emit(value: Subtype) {
    signal.send(value)
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-megacontroller&#34;&gt;The megacontroller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we need to create a simple app to leave a feedback for a movie we just watched; the feedback will be divided in two categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt;: the movie was &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;so and so&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;polarized&lt;/em&gt;: the movie was &lt;em&gt;very bad&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is going to present a page in which the user can select an &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;polarized&lt;/em&gt; feedback, and can tap a button that will present the user the available choices, i.e., respectively &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;son and so&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;very bad&lt;/em&gt;. The app is also going to thank the user if they&amp;rsquo;ve just left a positive feedback, but only if the previously left feedback was of lower value. The example is a little contrived but instructive, as we&amp;rsquo;re going to see. An &lt;strong&gt;easy, familiar approach&lt;/strong&gt; to the problem would be to start with the design of the two view controllers involved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt; will let the user select if the feedback is average or polarized, and will present a button to show the page where the actual feedback value will be selected; the &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt; will also show the currently selected feedback (or none) in a label;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code&gt;SelectionPage&lt;/code&gt; is going to present several buttons with the various feedback values (different based on the feedback category), and at the tap of a button the page should actually pop from the navigation stack, going back to the now-updated &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with our &lt;strong&gt;imperative mind&lt;/strong&gt; we would probably start by adding a sequence of instructions to the &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt;, that we&amp;rsquo;ll probably perceive as the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; controller of our app. But soon, we would probably notice that a lot of &lt;strong&gt;clearly separated&lt;/strong&gt; responsibilities are being collected in the &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code&gt;SelectionPage&lt;/code&gt; has to be constructed and initialized, and by doing this in &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt; we are imposing a strict &lt;strong&gt;dependency&lt;/strong&gt; between the two classes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after its initialization, the &lt;code&gt;SelectionPage&lt;/code&gt; must be presented to the user: we would probably embed &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;UINavigationController&lt;/code&gt;, then push the &lt;code&gt;SelectionPage&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt;, resulting in a strict coupling of the two classes with a particular navigation and presentation strategy (i.e., using a &lt;code&gt;UINavigationController&lt;/code&gt;) that is going to cause headaches if the use cases change (for example, in developing the &lt;strong&gt;iPad version&lt;/strong&gt; of the app);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a feedback value &lt;strong&gt;stored somewhere&lt;/strong&gt;, because we need to know if the user selected &lt;code&gt;average&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;polarized&lt;/code&gt;, and actually which was the selected feedback, because its value will be shown on the main page; the simplest solution seems to be just storing the selected feedback value in the &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt; class;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the act of &amp;ldquo;collecting the feedback&amp;rdquo; is a responsibility in itself, because the collected value is probably going to be used somewhere (for example, posting it to a web service);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We basically identified 4 different responsibilities, each of which is probably going to need its own class, but instead of thinking about the methods that need to be called on each one of them, we&amp;rsquo;re going to try and think with signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-model&#34;&gt;The model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if the model changes we need to update the text shown on the &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt;: a possible way to manage this could be to create a &lt;code&gt;ModelController&lt;/code&gt; class, which holds the model, and &lt;em&gt;emits a signal&lt;/em&gt; each time the model changes. Then, the &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt; could &lt;em&gt;react&lt;/em&gt; to this signal, and change the UI accordingly. A nice to way to do this is injecting the &lt;code&gt;ModelController&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt; constructor, so that &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt; can establish the appropriate bindings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Swift&#34;&gt;/// MainPage initializer
init(feedbackModelController: ModelController&amp;lt;FeedbackModel&amp;gt;) {
  super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
  feedbackModelController.updateSignal.onReception § eachTime § updateViewsWithFeedbackModel
  viewReadyEmitter.signal.onReception § eachTime § feedbackModelController.notify
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;§&lt;/code&gt; operator and the &lt;code&gt;eachTime&lt;/code&gt; function are just helpers to make the &lt;strong&gt;functional composition&lt;/strong&gt; easier: as it often happens with functional programming, or declarative programming in general, we can infer the meaning of an expression just by reading it; in fact, &lt;code&gt;onReception § eachTime § updateViewsWithFeedbackModel&lt;/code&gt; means that when the signal is received, the &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt; will update the view every time according to the new &lt;code&gt;FeedbackModel&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;eachTime&lt;/code&gt; means that every time the signal triggers, so will the update; this is in contrast with the &lt;code&gt;once&lt;/code&gt; function, that makes the object listen only to the first signal trigger. This is  related to the &lt;code&gt;Persistence&lt;/code&gt; of a &lt;code&gt;Signal&lt;/code&gt; observation, that is, if the object should continue listen to a signal or not: &lt;code&gt;Persistence&lt;/code&gt; is a single &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; with two values, &lt;code&gt;Continue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Stop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important characteristic of the view controllers is the fact that the views are not yet initialized in the constructor, so we often need to memorize some data and use it in the &lt;code&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/code&gt; method, that is called by the framework when all the views are loaded, and can consequently be manipulated; but we used a signal to express the update logic directly in the constructor, where the &lt;code&gt;ModelController&lt;/code&gt; is available: the line &lt;code&gt;viewReadyEmitter.signal.onReception § eachTime § feedbackModelController.notify&lt;/code&gt; means that when the &lt;code&gt;viewReadyEmitter&lt;/code&gt;, i.e., the emitter that will send a signal when the view is ready, is triggering, the model controller has to &lt;em&gt;notify&lt;/em&gt; its current value to all the observers; this way we don&amp;rsquo;t need to manually update the views in the &lt;code&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/code&gt; method: everything is connected, and the signals will &lt;strong&gt;propagate&lt;/strong&gt; according to the declarative bindings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;handling-page-creation-and-presentation&#34;&gt;Handling page creation and presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transitioning between pages is one the key points in iOS programming: page presentation has to be &lt;strong&gt;predictable and smooth&lt;/strong&gt;, to avoid a confusing user experience. One of the main premises of the &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; class was and still is the creation of a modular hierarchy of views, that&amp;rsquo;s independent from the way it&amp;rsquo;s presented to the user: that way we can easily reuse &lt;strong&gt;the same&lt;/strong&gt; view controller, for example, in full screen on the iPhone, or as a child view controller on a more complex hierarchy on iPad. The problem is that, if we write down the navigation and presentation logic &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the view controller class, we are going to establish tight dependencies between the view controller and its presentation, thus going against the premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible solution would be to use a &lt;code&gt;NavigationHandler&lt;/code&gt;, that will handle the transition between pages, along with the initial presentation during the application startup. The strategy here is to use a class that knows &lt;strong&gt;when and how&lt;/strong&gt; to present pages, oblivious of what pages actually do. For example, on receiving the appropriate signal from &lt;code&gt;MainPage&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;NavigationHandler&lt;/code&gt; will present the &lt;code&gt;SelectionPage&lt;/code&gt;. Where the &lt;code&gt;SelectionPage&lt;/code&gt; comes from? We should certainly avoid to burden the &lt;code&gt;NavigationHandler&lt;/code&gt; with pages&amp;rsquo; initialization responsibilities,  in fact we identified the class creation as a responsibility in itself. A frequent pattern used to handle the initialization of objects is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oodesign.com/factory-pattern.html&#34;&gt;Factory Pattern&lt;/a&gt;: a &lt;code&gt;PageFactory&lt;/code&gt; will construct our pages with the options passed to the factory constructor. Thus, &lt;code&gt;NavigationHandler&lt;/code&gt; will ask the &lt;code&gt;PageFactory&lt;/code&gt; for pages, through the methods &lt;code&gt;makeMainPage&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;makeSelectionPage&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we incur in a problem: &lt;code&gt;makeSelectionPage&lt;/code&gt; will just return a &lt;code&gt;SelectionPage&lt;/code&gt; object, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; the same instance, or a new instance each time. In fact, &lt;code&gt;PageFactory&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt; always the same page. This is important because the &lt;code&gt;NavigationHandler&lt;/code&gt; will only take care of page presentation, but the very same page instance has to be considered, for example, for collecting the feedback. A possible strategy would be to &lt;em&gt;cache&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;SelectionPage&lt;/code&gt;, but one of the main points of functional programming is &lt;strong&gt;avoiding state&lt;/strong&gt;: we don&amp;rsquo;t want to burden ourselves with the responsibility of managing mutable state, which is one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf&#34;&gt;main causes of complexity&lt;/a&gt; in software development. Instead, we will once again leverage signals to handle the situation. &lt;code&gt;PageFactory&lt;/code&gt; exposes two signals that are triggered at page creation; &lt;code&gt;NavigationHandler&lt;/code&gt;  uses those signal to bind its actions to the initialized pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Swift&#34;&gt;pageFactory.signalMakeMainPage
  .flatMap { $0.signalLeaveFeedback }
  .onReception § eachTime § inAnyCase § presentSelectionPage
  
pageFactory.signalMakeSelectionPage
  .flatMap { $0.signalSelection }
  .onReception § eachTime § inAnyCase § popTopPage
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the code just shown, the signals that are triggered when the pages are initialized are &lt;em&gt;flatMapped&lt;/em&gt; to the respective interaction signals, that is, the observed signal is a signal that will trigger when the second signal is triggered, but the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; signal will be available only when the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; signal is triggered: the &lt;code&gt;flatMap&lt;/code&gt; method will let us reference a signal that is not yet available. The &lt;code&gt;inAnyCase&lt;/code&gt; function is used because &lt;code&gt;NavigationHandler&lt;/code&gt; is not interested in the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of the signals, but just the fact that they are triggered; the content is going to be handled by another class: &lt;code&gt;FeedbackCollector&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;composing-signals&#34;&gt;Composing signals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FeedbackCollector&lt;/code&gt; has the responsibility of &lt;em&gt;collecting the whole feedback&lt;/em&gt;: this seems tricky, because the creation of a new feedback is not a synchronous procedure, and it&amp;rsquo;s the result of &lt;strong&gt;many different interactions&lt;/strong&gt; from the user in different contexts. As we saw, a signal is an abstraction over asynchronous programming: we declare the signal bindings for actions that will trigger at a certain point in time. Thanks to signals we can express the logic for collecting feedback in a single function call, executed during the app startup phase, even if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the app startup the pages are not yet initialized;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to actually collect the feedback various interactions in multiple pages will be needed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually these consideration would lead to &lt;strong&gt;stateful&lt;/strong&gt; computations, where state would be expressed in various points, and mutated. But the class &lt;code&gt;FeedbackCollector&lt;/code&gt; can generate a signal triggered each time a new feedback is collected with a single expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Swift&#34;&gt;func collectFeedbackModelChange() -&amp;gt; Signal&amp;lt;FeedbackModelChange&amp;gt; {
  return pageFactory.signalMakeMainPage
    .flatMap { $0.signalPolarizedChanged }
    .map(FeedbackModel.transformWithPolarized)
    + pageFactory.signalMakeSelectionPage
      .flatMap { $0.signalSelection }
      .map(FeedbackModel.transformWithFeedback)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator will literally &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; 2 signals together, producing a signal that is triggered each time either of the signals is triggered. The app uses the &lt;code&gt;Signal&amp;lt;FeedbackModelChange&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; produced by the &lt;code&gt;collectFeedbackModelChange()&lt;/code&gt; to update the model in the &lt;code&gt;ModelController&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of asynchronous reaction to signals is shown in the &lt;code&gt;AppDelegate&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s method &lt;code&gt;handleGoodFeedbacksWithAlert()&lt;/code&gt;; here&amp;rsquo;s the logic: if the user leaves a positive feedback, that is better than the previously left feedback, the app will show an alert, thanking the user. The entire logic for this is handled in the following expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Swift&#34;&gt;feedbackModelController.deltaSignal
  .filter { $0.feedback.rawValue &amp;lt; $1.feedback.rawValue}
  .filter { $1.feedback == .Good || $1.feedback == .ReallyGood }
  .onReception § eachTime § inAnyCase § showThankYouAlert
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ModelController&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;deltaSignal&lt;/code&gt; is triggered each time the model changes, and contains both the old and the new value: in the shown expression a signal is created by &lt;em&gt;filtering&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;deltaSignal&lt;/code&gt;, because we need a signal that is triggered only when the new feedback is different from the previous and positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clean and decoupled architecture is hard to get right, and can be obtained in different ways. Using signals will help us achieve the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we can work on &lt;strong&gt;a single piece at a time&lt;/strong&gt;, thinking about what &lt;em&gt;values&lt;/em&gt; are exchanged between classes, instead of interfaces and abstractions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to focus on what a view controller, or any class, really has to &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt;, that is, what value is going to yield in the economy of the app;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signals are not application-wide events: we don&amp;rsquo;t need a router or a dispatcher (like   &lt;code&gt;NSNotificationCenter&lt;/code&gt;) to properly handle them, because each object will declare its observation of specific signals. Also, because signals are easily transformed and composed, we can declaratively express our bindings without worrying about &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; things are going to happen, but just &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; we need. Of course our architecture has to take into account the fact that getting a &lt;em&gt;precise sequence of events&lt;/em&gt; is basically impossible when working with signals: actually, &lt;em&gt;sequencing&lt;/em&gt; is not even considered in declarative programming, because, along with &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt;, is a great cause of complexity. In the end, a declarative architecture, like everything, has its tradeoffs, but I still think it&amp;rsquo;s worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-lesson-we-learned-with-rest&#34;&gt;The lesson we learned with REST&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many developers, nowadays, building an &lt;strong&gt;API&lt;/strong&gt; for their applications essentially means mapping the &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt; of the domain to &lt;em&gt;URIs&lt;/em&gt;, with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer&#34;&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt; principles in mind.
Usually creating a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESTful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; system is not difficult, and the simplicity of the idea makes the task easier.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see some of the consequences and benefits of choosing REST:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every HTTP verb has its own meaning, allowing the developer to understand immediately what kind of operation (typically among the CRUD ones) is going to be performed on the resource identified by the URI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often the same URI can be used with multiple verbs to accomplish different tasks (e.g. &amp;ldquo;example.com/tag/123&amp;rdquo; refers to a particular tag that you can retrieve, update or delete).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controllers in many server-side frameworks can be created with a RESTful approach, each one of them representing one or more resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s often easy to come across some problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex URIs can be difficult to write or understand and sometimes they are subject to arbitrary interpretations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to filter collections you may need to use one or more ids embedded in the URL, but also &lt;em&gt;query parameters&lt;/em&gt;, e.g. when you want to sort the results of a GET by one particular field or retrieve resources by some field other than the id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no standard or easy way for the client to specify the list of fields that it needs, and the server will usually return all the data related to the requested resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More importantly, there is no standard way for the client to decide which resources related to the one requested should be returned, resulting in a lot of noise in the response content (unless the server application offers multiple endpoints to access the same resource but with different subsets of data&amp;hellip; but this could lead to API design problems).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t really blame REST for these and other cons. Its power comes from simplicity and developers are thankful for this breath of fresh air. You have just one transport layer, i.e. HTTP, with its features and rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s see how we can take a step forward and add some salt to our APIs, to make them even more powerful and expressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-way-to-design-api-graphql&#34;&gt;A new way to design API: GraphQL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GraphQL&lt;/strong&gt; maintains all the advantages of REST (relies on HTTP, very small overhead on requests, stateless and cacheable) and adds some very useful enhancements.
One of the main reasons why &lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; created it back in 2012 was the need to find a way to access data on their server that allowed any type of client and device (especially mobile site and app) to decide exactly what fields they need, reducing the payload and then minimizing the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of explaining all the features, which can be read in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://graphql.org/docs/getting-started/&#34;&gt;official guide&lt;/a&gt;, in this post we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on what makes GraphQL interesting.
In the next section we&amp;rsquo;ll use types and queries presented in our example project, that you can clone from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/poetcyborg/graphql-node-starter-kit&#34;&gt;this repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;types-and-fields-driven-queries&#34;&gt;Types and fields driven queries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query {
	games {
        id
	    title
	}
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous snippet describes a query issued by the client when it just needs to retrieve &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;title&lt;/em&gt; of a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
Since no argument has been passed to filter the data of the specified type (&lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt;), all the games will be retrieved.
The output for this query is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;games&amp;quot;: [{
        &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 1,
        &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Frogger&amp;quot;
      }, {
        &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 2,
        &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Galaxian&amp;quot;
      }, {
        &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 3,
        &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Tiger Road&amp;quot;
      }, {
        &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 4,
        &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Mendel Palace&amp;quot;
      }
    ]
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With REST, the same task could be accomplished with the following url:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /game?fields=id,title
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless the server applications is taking care of field filtering based on query params, all the information about every game will be returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query {
	games(id:2) {
        id
        title
        year
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query {
	games(title:&amp;quot;Frogger&amp;quot;) {
		id
        title
        year
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples #2 and #3 show a way to filter games by their &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;title&lt;/em&gt; respectively.
As you can see, the id has no semantic meaning like in REST, so you can describe the filter criterion in the same manner (&lt;em&gt;fieldname: &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The REST equivalent (selected fields are omitted) for Example #2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /game/2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and #3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /game?title=Frogger
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;relations-between-entities-graph-representation&#34;&gt;Relations between entities: graph representation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query {
    games(id:2) {
        title
        developer {
            name
            nation
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;types&lt;/strong&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Game&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt; are related to each other; in our example, for the sake of simplicity, a game can only have one company as developer and one as publisher, while any company can have multiple developed or published games.
In Example #4, you can notice the complex field &lt;em&gt;developer&lt;/em&gt;; we want to know the name and the nation of the company that developed the game with id = 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same two types can be reused to express the opposite of the relation described in the previous example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #5:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query {
    companies(name:&amp;quot;Game Freak&amp;quot;) {
        name
        gamesAsDeveloper {
            title
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see briefly how you can describe these relations in the &lt;strong&gt;Javascript&lt;/strong&gt; implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Game&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; type definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;developer: {
	type: Company,
    description: &#39;The developer of the game&#39;,
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gamesAsDeveloper: {
    type: new GraphQLList(Game),
    description: &#39;The games created as a developer&#39;,
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The field &lt;em&gt;developer&lt;/em&gt; is defined as type &lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt;, while the field &lt;em&gt;gamesAsDeveloper&lt;/em&gt; is a list of &lt;em&gt;Game&lt;/em&gt;.
Please refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/poetcyborg/graphql-node-starter-kit&#34;&gt;demo project&lt;/a&gt; for the full implementation of this example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;minimizing-the-number-of-requests-to-the-server&#34;&gt;Minimizing the number of requests to the server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we need the list of the &lt;em&gt;Japanese companies&lt;/em&gt; and some information about the games they worked on, but only for the &lt;em&gt;NES&lt;/em&gt; (Nintendo Entertainment System) platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query {
    companies(nation:&amp;quot;Japan&amp;quot;) {
	    name
        gamesAsDeveloper(platform:&amp;quot;NES&amp;quot;) {
		    title
	        year
        }
        gamesAsPublisher(platform:&amp;quot;NES&amp;quot;) {
            title
            year
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This query&amp;rsquo;s output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;companies&amp;quot;: [{
        &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Konami&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;gamesAsDeveloper&amp;quot;: [],
        &amp;quot;gamesAsPublisher&amp;quot;: []
      }, {
        &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Namco&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;gamesAsDeveloper&amp;quot;: [],
        &amp;quot;gamesAsPublisher&amp;quot;: [{
            &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Mendel Palace&amp;quot;,
            &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1989&amp;quot;
          }]
      }, {
        &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Game Freak&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;gamesAsDeveloper&amp;quot;: [{
            &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Mendel Palace&amp;quot;,
            &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1989&amp;quot;
          }],
        &amp;quot;gamesAsPublisher&amp;quot;: []
      }, {
        &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Capcom&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;gamesAsDeveloper&amp;quot;: [{
            &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Tiger Road&amp;quot;,
            &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1987&amp;quot;
          }],
        &amp;quot;gamesAsPublisher&amp;quot;: []
      }
    ]
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the REST world, the same response could be obtained in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by sending a request to an endpoint that was built exactly for the purpose of filtering companies and games by some fields, e.g.:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /companyWithGames?companyNation=Japan&amp;amp;gamePlatform=NES&amp;amp;fields=...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by sending several requests to more generic endpoints, e.g.:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /company?nation=Japan&amp;amp;fields=...
GET /game?developerName=[developer 1 name]&amp;amp;gamePlatform=NES&amp;amp;fields=...
GET /game?developerName=[developer 2 name]&amp;amp;gamePlatform=NES&amp;amp;fields=...
GET ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a couple of notable things here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the expressivity of the query language becomes more evident when things start becoming more interesting; filtering subsets of data feels natural and easy as you can just specify the criteria for the filters directly on the subtree root (companies -&amp;gt; nation, gamesAsDeveloper -&amp;gt; platform, gamesAsPublisher -&amp;gt; platform);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on server side, the developer can write the code to retrieve the data for every subset of data independently, considering that, when a request is sent, every subtree receives the data returned by the upper levels (in this case, filtering &lt;em&gt;games&lt;/em&gt; with the given &lt;em&gt;platform&lt;/em&gt; is performed only on companies with the selected &lt;em&gt;nation&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;api-documentation&#34;&gt;API Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you design a REST WebService, for every endpoint you&amp;rsquo;re mostly going to take care of its URI and the structure of the request and the response body.
Unfortunately, there is no standard way to document this information and make it available to the client developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With GraphQL, using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;introspection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you can ask the server information about the available types and their fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #7&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query {
    __schema {
        types {
            kind
            name
            description
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A query with the query root &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;__schema&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; returns the list of types with their descriptions and fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;__schema&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: [
		...
        {
          &amp;quot;kind&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;OBJECT&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Company&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;A company object&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;fields&amp;quot;: [...]
        }, {
          &amp;quot;kind&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;OBJECT&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Game&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;A game object&amp;quot;
          &amp;quot;fields&amp;quot;: [...]
        },
        ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to get the information about the types is using the query root &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;__type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, passing a specific type name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query {
    __type(name:&amp;quot;Game&amp;quot;) {
        fields {
            name
            description
            type {
                name
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;__type&amp;quot;: {
            &amp;quot;fields&amp;quot;: [{
                &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;,
                &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;The id of a game&amp;quot;,
                &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: {
                    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Int&amp;quot;
                }
            }, {
	            &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;,
                &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;The title of a game&amp;quot;,
                &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: {
                    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;String&amp;quot;
                }
            },
            ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mutations&#34;&gt;Mutations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about queries, but a few words need to be spent about the other important operation that you can perform on a GraphQL server: &lt;strong&gt;mutations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mutation {
	updateGameRating(id:2, rating:7) {
		id
		title
		rating
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntax is no different from the previous ones, except for the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; root.
It is the equivalent of a POST or a PATCH in REST, and lets us change the value of some fields in a resource.
In this example we are assigning a value (7) to the &lt;em&gt;rating&lt;/em&gt; field of the &lt;em&gt;Game&lt;/em&gt; types; this mutation could be defined in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
	name: &#39;UpdateGameRating&#39;,
	type: Game,
	args: {
	    rating: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLInt) },
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the specified type for the mutation is &lt;em&gt;Game&lt;/em&gt;; this means not only that the update should be performed on games, but also that the &lt;em&gt;Game&lt;/em&gt; field included in the request (id, title and rating) should be returned, just like a normal query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementations&#34;&gt;Implementations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the present article we sometimes referred to the official &lt;strong&gt;Javascript&lt;/strong&gt; library for GraphQL, but as you can see in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql&#34;&gt;this project&lt;/a&gt; there are many different implementations for the most popular languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-graphql&#34;&gt;The future of GraphQL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to say what will become of GraphQL in the next year.
Sure there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of hype around it, and for some very solid reasons.
It&amp;rsquo;s not going to replace REST in developers&amp;rsquo; hearts anytime soon, but if they&amp;rsquo;re brave enough, they can add a &lt;strong&gt;GraphQL layer&lt;/strong&gt; over an existing REST API in their application.
In fact, in my opinion, another good point of interest regarding GraphQL is the ability to aggregate multiple endpoints that reference various resources. Its nature is very domain-centric and it&amp;rsquo;s more  focused on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; data needs to be precisely retrieved, rather than on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;how to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some questions arise when you think about GraphQL in a more vast spectrum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to &lt;strong&gt;cache&lt;/strong&gt; resources on server-side, even if they were originally fetched using different queries? (Facebook is trying to give some answers with &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/thinking-in-relay.html&#34;&gt;Relay&lt;/a&gt;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to &lt;strong&gt;limit the access&lt;/strong&gt; to the resources (or the introspection on them) only to some users? GraphQL is authorization-agnostic, but as you can read in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/113&#34;&gt;this Github issue&lt;/a&gt; its a common problem that needs to be at least faced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire Facebook ecosystem of open source projects is worth of attention (don&amp;rsquo;t forget about React, Flux and the other Flux-like architectures) and, even if it&amp;rsquo;s very young, it has become very popular and used by many little and big companies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal hope is that every lesson that can be learned while working with these projects, especially GraphQL, might lead to a better World Wide Web and a better developing experience, maybe with more standard and free implementations than the Facebook (or Google, or Microsoft, or Apple) ones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Write a filesystem with FUSE</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/write-filesystem-fuse/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/write-filesystem-fuse/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;During the past year I experimented a lot with file systems in Userspace using FUSE, I wrote this post to share my thoughts about what I did and to give you a starting point to do something by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A filesystem is that piece of software that is in charge of storing, organizing and generally taking care of data represented as files and directories.
If you are using a device to read this post you are probably using at least one filesystem at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing a filesystem is not an easy task to accomplish and requires that a few parts of it have to be written at kernel level, fortunately that&amp;rsquo;s not our case since we are not writing a real on-disk filesystem, but rather we want to write something on top of it to solve a specific problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common tool to do that in user space is precisely &lt;strong&gt;FUSE, Filesystem in USErspace&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of filesystem examples built on top of FUSE out there that cover the most different use cases like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gluster.org/&#34;&gt;GlusterFS&lt;/a&gt;: scalable network filesystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs&#34;&gt;SSHFS&lt;/a&gt;: allows mounting a remote filesystem over SSH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sr71.net/projects/gmailfs/&#34;&gt;GMailFS&lt;/a&gt;: allows to use GMail storage as a filesystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://loggedfs.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;LoggedFS&lt;/a&gt;: filesystem that logs operations that happens in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main &lt;strong&gt;advantages&lt;/strong&gt; of FUSE over writing a low level kernel filesystem are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is usable by non-privileged users;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean and easy interface to do FS operations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has bindings in most available programming language;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need of advanced kernel development skills;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comes with user isolation, more secure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since you are not hacking in kernel space there are a few chances that a crash in your program takes down the entire system;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are also a few &lt;strong&gt;disadvantages&lt;/strong&gt; of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The target system need libfuse installed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slower than low level implementations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not the best option if you need multiple users to access your filesystem;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a flow-chart diagram showing how FUSE works, source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FUSE_structure.svg&#34;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/write-filesystem-fuse/FUSE_structure.svg&#34; alt=&#34;A flow-chart diagram showing how FUSE works&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;getting-started-with-fuse&#34;&gt;Getting started with FUSE&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section of the post is designed to introduce you on how to practically get your hands dirt with FUSE. Anyway you can understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on whether you execute the code or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;build-dependencies&#34;&gt;Build dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now you&amp;rsquo;ll need a few build dependencies and a text editor or an IDE to build and edit the code and do your experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;linux&#34;&gt;Linux&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCC or Clang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMake &amp;gt;= 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FUSE 2.6 or later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FUSE development files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To obtain those dependencies you can issue the following commands (depending on your Linux distribution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fedora/CentOS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;yum install gcc fuse fuse-devel make cmake
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debian/Ubuntu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;apt-get install gcc fuse libfuse-dev make cmake
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mac-osx&#34;&gt;Mac OSX&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command line tools for Xcode (contains Clang and make)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMake &amp;gt;= 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FUSE &amp;gt;= 2.6 or later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FUSE development files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can obtain all the needed dependencies at the following sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/&#34;&gt;Xcode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cmake.org/download/&#34;&gt;CMake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://osxfuse.github.io/&#34;&gt;OSXFuse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fuse-api&#34;&gt;FUSE API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to be aware of when working with FUSE is its API.
The libfuse library exposes a set of callbacks that you have to implement in order to tell your filesystem how to behave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most complete source of documentation on what are the callbacks and their behavior is the &lt;code&gt;fuse.h&lt;/code&gt; declaration file. You can find an online version &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/579c3b03f57856e369fd6db2226b77aba63b59ff/include/fuse.h#L102-L577&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-project&#34;&gt;Example project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of showing you how simple is the creation of a FUSE filesystem, I wrote this little implementation that, when mounted, only exposes a file named &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; and its content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the example project on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fntlnz/fuse-example&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the best way to start your own implementation is to take an example and start adding your features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as first thing clone the example project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/fntlnz/fuse-example.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the project structure is quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
├── CMake
│   └── FindFUSE.cmake
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── fuse-example.c
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cmakelists-txt-https-github-com-fntlnz-fuse-example-blob-master-cmakelists-txt&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fntlnz/fuse-example/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt&#34;&gt;CMakeLists.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know CMake is a tool used to manage project builds in a cross platform way. The scope of this file is to define what CMake is supposed to do for our project. The &lt;code&gt;CMake/FindFuse.cmake&lt;/code&gt; is needed in order to tell CMake where to find the FUSE related things while compiling/linking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fuse-example-c-https-github-com-fntlnz-fuse-example-blob-master-fuse-example-c&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fntlnz/fuse-example/blob/master/fuse-example.c&#34;&gt;fuse-example.c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where the magic actually happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example I implemented four of the FUSE API callbacks namely: getattr, open, read, readdir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;getattr&#34;&gt;getattr&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The getattr callback is in charge of reading the metadata of a given path, this  callback is always called before any operation made on the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;static int getattr_callback(const char *path, struct stat *stbuf) {
  memset(stbuf, 0, sizeof(struct stat));

  if (strcmp(path, &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;) == 0) {
    stbuf-&amp;gt;st_mode = S_IFDIR | 0755;
    stbuf-&amp;gt;st_nlink = 2;
    return 0;
  }

  if (strcmp(path, filepath) == 0) {
    stbuf-&amp;gt;st_mode = S_IFREG | 0777;
    stbuf-&amp;gt;st_nlink = 1;
    stbuf-&amp;gt;st_size = strlen(filecontent);
    return 0;
  }

  return -ENOENT;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we are doing here is simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the value of path equals to root &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, we declare it as a directory and return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the value of path equals to filepath &lt;code&gt;/file&lt;/code&gt;, we declare it as a file and explicit its size and then return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise nothing exists at the given path, and we return &lt;code&gt;-ENOENT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we are telling FUSE that the current entry is a file or a directory using the &lt;code&gt;stat&lt;/code&gt; struct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, if the entry is a directory, &lt;code&gt;st_mode&lt;/code&gt; have to be set to &lt;code&gt;S_IFDIR&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;st_nlink&lt;/code&gt; to 2, while if it&amp;rsquo;s a file, &lt;code&gt;st_mode&lt;/code&gt; have to be set to &lt;code&gt;S_IFREG&lt;/code&gt; (that stands for regular file) and &lt;code&gt;st_nlink&lt;/code&gt; to 1. Files also require that the &lt;code&gt;st_size&lt;/code&gt; (the full file size) is specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/sysstat.h.html&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can find more information about &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sys/stat.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;open&#34;&gt;open&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open callback is called when the system requests for a file to be opened. Since we don&amp;rsquo;t have real file but only in-memory representations, we are going to implement this callback just because is needed for FUSE to work and therefore return 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;read&#34;&gt;read&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This callback is called when FUSE is reading data from an opened file.
It should return exactly the number of bytes requested and fill the second argument &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; with the content of those bytes.
As done in the getattr callback, here I&amp;rsquo;m checking if the given path equals to a known one, I copy the &lt;code&gt;filecontent&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; and then return the requested number of bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;static int read_callback(const char *path, char *buf, size_t size, off_t offset,
    struct fuse_file_info *fi) {

  if (strcmp(path, filepath) == 0) {
    size_t len = strlen(filecontent);
    if (offset &amp;gt;= len) {
      return 0;
    }

    if (offset + size &amp;gt; len) {
      memcpy(buf, filecontent + offset, len - offset);
      return len - offset;
    }

    memcpy(buf, filecontent + offset, size);
    return size;
  }

  return -ENOENT;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;readdir&#34;&gt;readdir&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The readdir callback has the task of telling FUSE the exact structure of the accessed directory.
Since at the moment the only available directory is &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, this function always return its representation, we are doing it by filling &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; with the two links for the upper directory &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; and current directory &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; and with the only file we have: &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;static int readdir_callback(const char *path, void *buf, fuse_fill_dir_t filler,
    off_t offset, struct fuse_file_info *fi) {
  (void) offset;
  (void) fi;

  filler(buf, &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;, NULL, 0);
  filler(buf, &amp;quot;..&amp;quot;, NULL, 0);

  filler(buf, filename, NULL, 0);

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;main&#34;&gt;main&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function here is acting as a proxy to the &lt;code&gt;fuse_main&lt;/code&gt; passing arguments through it and configuring it with the implemented FUSE operation callbacks via the &lt;code&gt;fuse_example_operations&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;static struct fuse_operations fuse_example_operations = {
  .getattr = getattr_callback,
  .open = open_callback,
  .read = read_callback,
  .readdir = readdir_callback,
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  return fuse_main(argc, argv, &amp;amp;fuse_example_operations, NULL);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;build-and-run&#34;&gt;Build and run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember that you installed CMake, make, gcc and libfuse? It&amp;rsquo;s time to use them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first tool we are using is CMake to &lt;strong&gt;check dependencies, setup environment and generate Makefiles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want Debug flags and other development related enabled features, just change &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Release&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second tool we are using is &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, that using the CMake generated &lt;strong&gt;Makefiles&lt;/strong&gt; is now able to build our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;make -j
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-j&lt;/code&gt; parts tells make to parallelize the build to all your cores, remove it if you run out of CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that everything is ready, if no build error has occurred, we can enjoy our new filesystem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;run&#34;&gt;Run!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before doing anything we need a mountpoint, so let&amp;rsquo;s create the directory where the filesystem will be mounted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir /tmp/example
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then, mount the filesystem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./bin/fuse-example -d -s -f /tmp/example
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now check that it has been mounted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ls -la
total 0
drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   0 Jan  1  1970 .
drwxrwxrwt. 14 root root 320 Jan 10 16:03 ..
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 root root  49 Jan  1  1970 file

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mount | grep fuse-example
fuse-example on /tmp/example type fuse.fuse-example (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=1000,group_id=1000)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may notice, we mounted the filesystem with three arguments which are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;d&lt;/strong&gt;: enable debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;: run single threaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f&lt;/strong&gt;: stay in foreground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the list of all mount options using &lt;code&gt;-h&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An important thing to notice is that write and read operations by default have a size of 4kb so if your file is, let&amp;rsquo;s say, 399kb you have to deal with the fact that to read it the read callback will be called 100 times with 100 different offset and 99 equals size but one that will have 3kb as size because the file is 399kb and not 400kb so the latest chunk has size 3kb and not 4kb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FUSE is more secure than low level kernel development, but security is not free so if you are going to write a network filesystem, for example you may want not to mount it as root.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, accessing the mounted filesystem for other users is not allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were my 2 cents, if you are interested in seeing something from me I started a little project on GitHub to create a filesystem that can use online services via FUSE to store data. You can find the project here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fntlnz/webfs&#34;&gt;WebFS on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;
