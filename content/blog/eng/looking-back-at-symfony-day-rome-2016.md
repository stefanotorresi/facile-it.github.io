Every year the [GrUSP](http://www.grusp.org/), in cooperation with one of the italian PHP user groups, organizes the italian **[Symfony](http://symfony.com/)** conference. This year the [event](http://2016.symfonyday.it/) was organized in the Capital on 28th October with the help of [PHP User Group Roma](http://roma.grusp.org/), and a part of Facile Dev Team was there for the occasion. In Facile we believe attending to events like this is a good way to learn new things, share practical experiences and improve our network.

This post would be a short recap of all the talks.

How many ways can we split a webapp? Why smaller is better? How services can interact each other? In his talk Michele answered all those questions focusing on all the advantages of the proposed architecture and a few common pitfalls.
