Every year [PHP User Group Roma](http://roma.grusp.org/) in cooperation with [GrUSP](http://www.grusp.org/) organizes the Italian **[Symfony](http://symfony.com/)** conference. This year the [event](http://2016.symfonyday.it/) was organized in the Capital on 28th October and a part of Facile Dev Team was there for the occasion. In Facile we belive attending to events like this is a good way to learn new things, share practical experiences and improve our network.

## PHP7 e Rich Domain Model

Talk by **[Massimiliano Arione](https://twitter.com/garakkio)**
<br/>Duration 30 minutes in length

In this talk Massimiliano told about his experience in the migration to PHP7 of a Symfony based project. Particularly he focused on the usage of type hinting and return types and the issues encountered with an [Anemic Domain Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemic_domain_model) approach suggested by the framework official documentation. He showed how to combine a Rich Domain Model without giving up new language features.

Talk is focused on [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch). Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine with a great Symfony integration.

<br/>Duration 45 minutes in length
