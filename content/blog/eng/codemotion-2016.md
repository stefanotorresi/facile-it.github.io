*«Learn or die»*. These are the words with which [**Codemotion Milan 2016**](http://milan2016.codemotionworld.com/) started on 25th November. Most of our development team attended this tech conference like the [previous year](http://engineering.facile.it/blog/ita/facile-it-devs-codemotion-milan-2015/). Moreover [Facile.it](http://www.facile.it) was present at the event as a sponsor with his stand looking for new talent.

During the event we also officially announced the second [**#FacileHack**](http://hackathon.facile.it/) planned for the next year.

This post would be a short recap of some talks in chronological order. The choice of the talk is based on the personal taste of the various members of the editorial staff of Facile.it Engineering blog.

# Day 1

## The new features of PHP 7
 * Enrico Zimuel ([@ezimuel](https://twitter.com/ezimuel))
 * 11:30 – 12:10 #programming ([slide](http://zimuel.it/slides/codemotion2016/))

Enrico Zimuel, Software Engineer at [Zend Technologies](http://www.zend.com/), the company that is behind PHP, talks about some of the new features of PHP 7: the scalar type and return type declaretions, the spaceship and null coalescing operators, the anonymous classes, the consistent 64-bit support, etc. Futhermore he explains why PHP 7 is twice as fast compared to the previous version and it has 30% lower memory consumption.

# Day 2

## MicroMonolith - Top anti-patterns of adopting distributed system
 * Michal Franc ([@francmichal](https://twitter.com/francmichal))
 * 12:30 – 13:10 #architectures
 
In this talk, Michal reports his (and his team) experience in the infamous transistion from a monolithic app to a microservice
oriented architecture. Michal works at [@JustGiving](https://twitter.com/JustGiving), which mainly uses .NET, but he didn't
focus on the specific technology, but rather on the generic problems and pitfalls that this kind of transition brings to
the table. During his tale, he laid to us a lot of useful suggestions and common issues to look for.

## Gang of Four Patterns in a Functional Light
 * Mario Fusco ([@mariofusco](https://twitter.com/mariofusco))
 * 14:10 – 14:50 #programming ([slide](link))
