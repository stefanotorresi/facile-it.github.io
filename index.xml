      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining &lt;strong&gt;state&lt;/strong&gt; is the main cause of complexity and headaches in software development: without a careful consideration of state, our projects will inevitably become impossible to understand. In fact, various development techniques and programming styles are mainly there to handle state in a responsible way: for example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;monads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as used in functional programming, are often employed for this very task. A good general way of managing state is trying to make it &lt;strong&gt;immutable&lt;/strong&gt;, either through the use &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_type&#34;&gt;value types&lt;/a&gt;, that is, types which instances are passed around with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy&#34;&gt;deep copy&lt;/a&gt; semantics, or simple &lt;em&gt;immutable objects&lt;/em&gt;, which have reference semantics but because they&amp;rsquo;re immutable their state is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the &lt;em&gt;processes&lt;/em&gt; we usually represent in code are all but immutable: the state of any running software is probably going to change as time passes, as a result of &lt;em&gt;foreign interactions&lt;/em&gt;, a.k.a., &lt;em&gt;side effects&lt;/em&gt;. This means that something, somewhere has to mutate, and to be more precise we can say that the information stored in a certain object is going to change: actually, an &lt;strong&gt;information&lt;/strong&gt; by itself is a &lt;strong&gt;constant&lt;/strong&gt; value, but from time to time that object is going to store different pieces of information, some are going to be new, others are going to be outdated. So there&amp;rsquo;s no escape from mutation: the point is to mutate &lt;strong&gt;responsibly&lt;/strong&gt;, that is, to not be reckless with our mutable objects, and treat them in a special way so that we can still reason about our code and easily understand the state of our system at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The already cited techniques based on monads represent a good way to solve the problem, but monads only really work in a functional programming context, something that&amp;rsquo;s not everyone&amp;rsquo;s cup of tea, and to be really productive while using them you need to &lt;em&gt;think in terms of monads&lt;/em&gt;, and treat them as primitive objects. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about monads or functional programming in general, my focus for this article is analyzing mutability in software, while identifying common techniques that can be leveraged in any programming language/paradigm to improve our code. In particular I want to talk about 3 specific problems that arise while working with mutable objects, and 3 solutions to address them. To quickly summarize, my suggestions will be the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be idempotent;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;react to change;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proceed one-way only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see each one of them in detail by developing a concrete example: an object that represents a &lt;em&gt;payment process&lt;/em&gt;, which at any moment can be in various states, like &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;succeeded&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;failed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-idempotent&#34;&gt;Be idempotent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mutate an object from the outside we usually &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; the object to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something. If we truly want to respect the object-oriented paradigm, and in particular if we don&amp;rsquo;t want to violate &lt;strong&gt;encapsulation&lt;/strong&gt;, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t make assumptions about the internal state of a certain object after a certain method call; still, we cannot help but making assumptions about the way our entire &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt; is going to work after a method call, otherwise it would be impossible to reason about code. But if our changes are &lt;em&gt;incremental&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be really hard to understand the system even after a simple method call. Not all changes are created equal: if the resulting system&amp;rsquo;s state is affected by the previous one, before the change takes place, then it&amp;rsquo;s going to be basically impossible to reason about the system after the change, because in our reasoning we should take into account all the possible conditions the system was in. An incremental change, for example a method call to &lt;em&gt;increase a counter&lt;/em&gt;, will overload our mind of conditional paths and will cause bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, for our &lt;code&gt;PaymentProcess&lt;/code&gt; we don&amp;rsquo;t want to be able to generically &lt;em&gt;advance&lt;/em&gt; the payment state: we want to advance it to a particular stage, with a clean method call that should be &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;idempotent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that is, calling it 1 time, 2 times or 100 times &lt;strong&gt;has to be the same&lt;/strong&gt;. This also means that if more objects call the same method, it will be like if only one object called it, and this will completely remove a running cause of bugs: multiple, uncoordinated interactions of the same type with an object. Idempotence is a simple concept, but it&amp;rsquo;s extremely powerful: with it, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep track if a particular operation has already occurred (thus saving some state), but to properly implement it we need the correct semantics: while &lt;em&gt;delta&lt;/em&gt; operations are very frequent in real life (think about increasing the volume of a TV set) and are usually harmless, they can be dangerous in software development, an in general it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand the what &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; natural in real life is not necessarily a good thing in software engineering, or engineering in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, notice that while an idempotent method call will always have the same result on a particular instance, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that will have the same result on &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; instances - more on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;react-to-change&#34;&gt;React to change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reactivemanifesto.org&#34;&gt;Reactive programming&lt;/a&gt; has been big the last few years, and that&amp;rsquo;s mostly thanks both to the popularity achieved by functional programming in OOP circles, and to the diffusion of architectures based on microservices. But the idea of &lt;em&gt;being reactive&lt;/em&gt; in software development has been around for much more than that: for example, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;observer pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been there for decades, and the basic underlying idea is that of &lt;em&gt;connecting&lt;/em&gt; objects by establishing relations between them in which a state change is automatically propagated to a collection of &lt;em&gt;observers&lt;/em&gt;. It is responsibility of an observer to react to what just happened, while the &lt;em&gt;observable&lt;/em&gt; object doesn&amp;rsquo;t really care about what the others will do. This will allow us to achieve the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a nice &lt;em&gt;decoupling&lt;/em&gt; between a mutable object and other objects that for any reason are interested in its mutation; no custom interface will be needed, just a simple fixed method (like &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;) to pass around the new information;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a more &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt; code style, in which our method calls will only describe the intent of connecting one or more objects to a chain of reactions (and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754&#34;&gt;functional reactive programming&lt;/a&gt; is particularly good a that).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About our payment example, whatever object is interested in a change of state, like for example UI objects the will show different views to the user based on the current payment stage, should really subscribe to our payment object to receive &lt;em&gt;signals&lt;/em&gt; about its mutation: the payment object itself should then send these changes to the observers. Notice that I used the  word &lt;em&gt;send&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;broadcast&lt;/em&gt;: the change of state of a particular object should usually not be treated as an all-encompassing &lt;em&gt;event&lt;/em&gt;. Events are really about application wide changes (like a phone call during the execution of a mobile application): there are many ways to implement our observables and observers, the point is simply to have a clean, fixed API to &lt;em&gt;emit&lt;/em&gt; an information, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://reactivex.io&#34;&gt;ReactiveX&lt;/a&gt; could be a nice starting point to get an idea about the possible APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;proceed-one-way-only&#34;&gt;Proceed one-way only&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be controversial but it&amp;rsquo;s extremely important. Consider the following case: our payment process object has idempotent methods and a reactive API, so a view controller object can keep a UI updated and send back user interactions to advance the process. But while the process is in &amp;ldquo;working&amp;rdquo; stage something goes wrong and the process fails: not a problem, we actually considered the &amp;ldquo;failed&amp;rdquo; stage, so the &lt;code&gt;PaymentProcess&lt;/code&gt; is updated accordingly. But we would actually like to retry the payment, and of course update everything accordingly in our reactive chain. What should we do? Set our &lt;code&gt;PaymentProcess&lt;/code&gt; back to &amp;ldquo;working&amp;rdquo;? That would be possible, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to make everything more complex, because all the observers should in theory take into account the fact the this is not the first attempt to pay (the UI for example could show a &amp;ldquo;retry&amp;rdquo; message instead of the usual one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, we want to &lt;em&gt;solve&lt;/em&gt; a state problem, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to distribute it to multiple objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case could be a complete stop of the payment process (the user could cancel it, for example, or the session could expire): we don&amp;rsquo;t want to bring back the &lt;code&gt;PaymentProcess&lt;/code&gt; instance, forcing all observer to do some kind of cleanup. In any case, a process that goes back and forth makes reasoning about code really hard, because &lt;strong&gt;it makes the future more complex&lt;/strong&gt;: all the objects that depend on a mutable object are going to be easier to implement if we can assume that the mutability will only proceed in one direction. Of course this is not easy to implement, but in this case it&amp;rsquo;s really natural to think about it: if the milk is running out in the evening, I cannot expect the bottle to magically refill for the morning, so I should start thinking about a different breakfast. Processes that are invertible usually require some form of external, high-level coordination, and from an architectural standpoint the idea of an object that mutates in any possible way might seem harmless: but at the implementation level this will cause problems, and bugs are in the implementation, not in the architecture. While implementing new features, refactoring, debugging or simply studying a codebase we reason about the code, not the architecture, and &lt;em&gt;coordinator&lt;/em&gt; objects are classic jack-of-all-trades at the architecture level: but unfortunately, an implementation that requires external coordination is going to be more complex and error-prone, so it&amp;rsquo;s better to be clear about the mutation path for an object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our particular case, we could consider one or more &amp;ldquo;retry&amp;rdquo; stages, or a single &amp;ldquo;retry&amp;rdquo; stage with an associated object that represents the number of retries. And about the possibility of going back to the beginning, in that case we should really &lt;strong&gt;discard the whole process&lt;/strong&gt;: the process owner, that would have likely activated the various accessory objects (like the ones for the UI) should &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; for an &amp;ldquo;abort&amp;rdquo; stage, that would make it kill everything and start the process anew. There might be performance concerns: to mutate objects is usually faster than recreating them, but again, it can be managed and it&amp;rsquo;s better to have cleaner, more understandable code from the beginning, so that it&amp;rsquo;s going to be easier to make fine calibrations in later stages, than to create a mess in the name of early optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final question: if the process is one-way only, what happens if some object tries to set it to a previous stage with a method call? &lt;strong&gt;Absolutely nothing&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;ignore-if-impossible&lt;/em&gt; semantics is actually clean and reasonable, and we don&amp;rsquo;t need errors or exceptions to handle: even if this has to be taken into account at every method call, the important thing is to be &lt;strong&gt;clear&lt;/strong&gt; about it, and the alternative is much worse. This whole article could be summarized in the phrase &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;clear semantics are what makes mutability bearable&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. In this particular case, the fact that a method call is ignored or not doesn&amp;rsquo;t change our reasoning: I&amp;rsquo;m not going to make assumptions about the state of &lt;code&gt;PaymentProcess&lt;/code&gt; after the call, because I&amp;rsquo;m actually reacting to its changes in a separate context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We considered a bunch of possible problems to think about when implementing mutable objects, and some options to confront them. Of course these ideas are purposely very general: every problem is different, every codebase is unique. But applying even just one of these techniques will most likely result in more clear and understandable code. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t talk about application-wide mutation, because that&amp;rsquo;s really an architectural thing; my goal is to raise awareness about the concept of mutation and variable instance properties in every single class. We should always &lt;strong&gt;avoid&lt;/strong&gt; mutation when possible, and concentrate our variable state in a few, carefully controlled places; but if we&amp;rsquo;re not careful, even a single mutating class in a multiple class project could wreak havoc, and force use to debug and fix a system that we thought was clean and well structured.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;«Learn or die»&lt;/em&gt;. These are the words with which &lt;a href=&#34;http://milan2016.codemotionworld.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codemotion Milan 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; started on the 25th of November. Most of our development team attended this tech conference like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/blog/ita/facile-it-devs-codemotion-milan-2015/&#34;&gt;previous year&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facile.it&#34;&gt;Facile.it&lt;/a&gt; was present at the event as a sponsor with his stand looking for new talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the event we also officially &lt;strong&gt;announced the second &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackathon.facile.it/&#34;&gt;#FacileHack&lt;/a&gt; hackathon&lt;/strong&gt;, which is planned for &lt;strong&gt;march 2017&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post would be a short recap of some talks in chronological order. The choice of the talks is based on the personal taste of the various members of the editorial staff of Facile.it Engineering blog. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/codemotion-2016-in-review/codemotion_2016.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A part of Facile Dev Team&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-new-features-of-php-7&#34;&gt;The new features of PHP 7&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enrico Zimuel (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ezimuel&#34;&gt;@ezimuel&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11:30 – 12:10 #programming (&lt;a href=&#34;http://zimuel.it/slides/codemotion2016/&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enrico Zimuel, Software Engineer at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zend.com/&#34;&gt;Zend Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind the PHP engine, talks about some of the new features of PHP 7: the scalar type and return type declarations, the spaceship and null coalescing operators, the anonymous classes, the consistent 64-bit support, etc. Furthermore he explains why PHP 7 is twice as fast compared to the previous version and it has 30% lower memory consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-and-lastminute-com-our-course-towards-better-scalability-and-processes&#34;&gt;Kubernetes and lastminute.com: our course towards better scalability and processes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michele Orsi (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/micheleorsi&#34;&gt;@micheleorsi&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11:30 – 12:10 #devops (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/micheleorsi/kubernetes-and-lastminutecom-our-course-towards-better-scalability-and-processes&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastminute.com recently started a migration from a monolithic app to a microservice approach, leveraging the power of Kubernetes, the open source project lead by Google for container orchestration. This was quite the effort, and it unveiled a great deal of advantages and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;continuous-budgeting&#34;&gt;Continuous budgeting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Francesco Fullone (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fullo&#34;&gt;@fullo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:10 - 15:50 #inspirational&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is about being agile in the entrepeneur side of our profession: how to plan and adapt to change when deciding how and how much to spend in our coding ventures; re-evaluating is key, and the only way to success is a delicate balance between maintenance and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-65k-and-beyond&#34;&gt;To ∞ (~65K) and beyond!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sebastiano Gottardo (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rotxed&#34;&gt;@rotxed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16:10 - 16:50 #mobile (&lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/dextor/to-65k-and-beyond&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of old -but still widely used- Android devices are natively limited to run apps with less than 65K method references (due to the Dalvik JVM). For many apps this could be a serious problem. During the talk Sebastiano, an Android engineer at Musixmatch, gave a very comprehensive and clear explanation of the problem and went through all the possible solutions showing some really useful tips to deal or better &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;functional-reactive-programming-with-kotlin-on-android&#34;&gt;Functional Reactive Programming with Kotlin on Android&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giorgio Natili (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/giorgionatili&#34;&gt;@giorgionatili&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17:10 - 17:50 #mobile (&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxCm4NRlzb3PWjNNaG1KS0Utckk/view&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of this talk was very interesting considering the fact that both the functional paradigm and the Kotlin language are used within the Facile.it Android app. But actually I have to say that I found a 40 minutes talk not suitable as a format to address these two large topics together (72 slides!). I would have preferred two separate talks, but it was nevertheless an interesting presentation full of useful tips and advices about Kotlin and FRP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coding-culture&#34;&gt;Coding Culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sven Peters (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/svenpet&#34;&gt;@svenpet&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:30 - 11:10 #inspirational (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/svenpeters/coding-culture&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his keynote Sven Peters, Evangelist for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atlassian.com/&#34;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;, explains - in a very geek style - what is &lt;em&gt;company culture&lt;/em&gt;, referring in particular to his company. He says that when people work in a great coding culture they are motivated and they are mostly very productive, but also they will have more responsibility and investment in the features they are developing. Developers will have more freedom to change their roles and try out new stuff, this is the right way to make better products with happier developers. He concluded his speech with these words: &lt;em&gt;«Products may change, but never forget values, cultivate your culture!»&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;micromonolith-top-anti-patterns-of-adopting-distributed-system&#34;&gt;MicroMonolith - Top anti-patterns of adopting distributed system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michal Franc (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/francmichal&#34;&gt;@francmichal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12:30 – 13:10 #architectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Michal reports his (and his team) experience in the infamous transistion from a monolithic app to a microservice oriented architecture. Michal works at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JustGiving&#34;&gt;@JustGiving&lt;/a&gt;, which mainly uses .NET, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t focus on the specific technology, but rather on the generic problems and pitfalls that this kind of transition brings to the table. During his tale, he laid to us a lot of useful suggestions and common issues to look for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;develop-applications-in-big-data-era-with-scala-and-spark&#34;&gt;Develop applications in Big Data Era with Scala and Spark&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mario Cartia (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mariocartia&#34;&gt;@mariocartia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12:30 – 13:10 #cloud #bigdata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large amount of data are produced everyday and Big Data is a concept increasingly trendy. In his talk Mario Cartia presented Scala and Spark,two powerful tools suitable to Big Data Processing.  Scala is a General purpose programming language that combines the benefits of OOP and functional programming. Apache Spark is an open source framework and it&amp;rsquo;s a fast engine for big data processing, based on Scala language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gang-of-four-patterns-in-a-functional-light&#34;&gt;Gang of Four Patterns in a Functional Light&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mario Fusco (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mariofusco&#34;&gt;@mariofusco&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:10 – 14:50 #programming (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mariofusco/from-gof-to-lambda&#34;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this live-coding talk, Mario Fusco uses Java (and new Java 1.8 features) to translate the wide-known GoF design patterns into functional programming, making the code a lot less verbose, reducing the noise of boilerplate over the really important code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, kittens:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Every year the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.grusp.org/&#34;&gt;GrUSP&lt;/a&gt;, in cooperation with one of the italian PHP user groups, organizes the italian &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://symfony.com/&#34;&gt;Symfony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; conference. This year the &lt;a href=&#34;http://2016.symfonyday.it/&#34;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; was organized in the Capital on 28th October with the help of &lt;a href=&#34;http://roma.grusp.org/&#34;&gt;PHP User Group Roma&lt;/a&gt;, and a part of Facile Dev Team was there for the occasion. In Facile we believe attending to events like this is a good way to learn new things, share practical experiences and improve our network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post would be a short recap of all the talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/looking-back-at-symfony-day-rome-2016/faciledev_symfonyday_2016.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A part of Facile Dev Team&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;symfony-and-micro-not-so-much-service&#34;&gt;Symfony and micro (not so much) service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_orso_&#34;&gt;Michele Orselli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michele Orselli presented a case study of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application&#34;&gt;monolithic application&lt;/a&gt; broken down into many smaller microservices. How many ways can we split a webapp? Why smaller is better? How services can interact each other? In his talk Michele answered all those questions focusing on all the advantages of the proposed architecture and a few common pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scaling-symfony-apps&#34;&gt;Scaling Symfony apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mat_teo8&#34;&gt;Matteo Moretti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 45 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A scalable application must support an increasing amount of data or a growing number of users. In his talk, Matteo Moretti described the architecture needed to scale. He divided the overall architecture into 4 main components: web server, sessions, database and the filesystem. He explained the right configuration to his main purpose: improving performance of a webapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;e-commerce-with-symfony-from-case-study-to-reality&#34;&gt;E-commerce with Symfony: from case study to reality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dymissy&#34;&gt;Simone D&amp;rsquo;Amico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sylius, Elcodi, Thelia, Sonata Project, Well Commerce, Shop Plus, Aimeos: these are the most popular results you can find if you google  &amp;ldquo;e-commerce solution with Symfony&amp;rdquo;. But which one is the final winner? Why choosing one or another? Simone D&amp;rsquo;Amico reviewed all of these frameworks and libraries comparing strengths and drawbacks. Moreover he clarified the stack he used to build an e-commerce platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-journey-into-symfony-form-component&#34;&gt;A journey into Symfony form component&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SamueleLilli&#34;&gt;Samuele Lilli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 45 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html&#34;&gt;Symfony form component&lt;/a&gt; is the main obstacle for beginners and newbies in the Symfony world. Samuele Lilli gave a talk with the purpose to clarify this hot topic with a lot of examples and code snippets. He started from the simplest form examples to more advanced ones. He revealed a lot of tips and explanations for several scenarios in order to make this powerful component understandable and manageable by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;php7-and-rich-domain-model&#34;&gt;PHP7 and Rich Domain Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/garakkio&#34;&gt;Massimiliano Arione&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk Massimiliano Arione told about his experience in the migration to PHP7 of a Symfony based project. Particularly he focused on the usage of type hinting and return types and the issues encountered with an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemic_domain_model&#34;&gt;Anemic Domain Model&lt;/a&gt; approach suggested by the framework official documentation. He showed how to combine a Rich Domain Model without giving up new language features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;relevance-sorting-with-elasticsearch-and-a-bit-of-maths&#34;&gt;Relevance sorting with Elasticsearch &amp;amp; a bit of maths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk by: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mattbit_&#34;&gt;Matteo Dora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 45 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main topic of the talk was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch&#34;&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt;. Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine with a great Symfony integration. Matteo Dora, the speaker of this talk, explained how to deal when the sorting by relevance becomes hard using the right amount of math and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSElasticaBundle&#34;&gt;FOSElasticaBundle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MessagePack: an alternative to JSON?</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/message-pack-an-alternative-to-json/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/message-pack-an-alternative-to-json/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about data interchange in web applications, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.json.org/&#34;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the de-facto standard, especially in developing RESTful web services. JSON won against its antagonist &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/XML/&#34;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; (SOAP) without a battle, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t prevent the development of alternatives like &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/&#34;&gt;Google’s &lt;strong&gt;Protocol Buffers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://avro.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache &lt;strong&gt;Avro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://msgpack.org/&#34;&gt;MessagePack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In being thorough, we should also mention &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gzip.org/&#34;&gt;gzip&lt;/a&gt; JSON compression (sometimes called &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;JSONC&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://bsonspec.org/&#34;&gt;BSON&lt;/a&gt;, a bin­ary-en­coded seri­al­iz­a­tion of JSON-like doc­u­ments, both derived directly from JSON. In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss MessagePack in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/message-pack-an-alternative-to-json/msgpack.png&#34; alt=&#34;MessagePack&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;JSON Vs MessagePack (source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://msgpack.org/&#34;&gt;msgpack.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-messagepack&#34;&gt;What is MessagePack?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;« &lt;em&gt;MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it&amp;rsquo;s faster and smaller&lt;/em&gt; ». To start using MessagePack we need to convert our application objects into MessagePack format: this process is called &lt;em&gt;serialization&lt;/em&gt;, while the reverse process is called &lt;em&gt;deserialization&lt;/em&gt;. The following example can help us better understand what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about. Consider this simple JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
	&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 4,                    // integer
	&amp;quot;isActive&amp;quot;: true,           // boolean
	&amp;quot;fullname&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Homer Simpson&amp;quot; // string
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSON requires 56 bytes to represent a very simple user object, while MessagePack only needs 38 bytes (compression ratio 1.47, yielding a 32% saving in size). See below the output of the serialization process for the above JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;83 a2 69 64 04 a8 69 73 41 63 74 69 76 65 c3 a8 66 75 6c 6c 6e 61 6d 65 ad 48 6f 6d 65 72 20 53 69 6d 70 73 6f 6e
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see how MessagePack serialization works by reading the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md&#34;&gt;official specification&lt;/a&gt;. Also, we can split the previous hexadecimal representation to emphasize and explain data types as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;83                                          // 3-element map
a2 69 64                                    // 2-byte string &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;
04                                          // integer 4
a8 69 73 41 63 74 69 76 65                  // 8-byte string &amp;quot;isActive&amp;quot; 
c3                                          // boolean true
a8 66 75 6c 6c 6e 61 6d 65                  // 8-byte string &amp;quot;fullname&amp;quot;
ad 48 6f 6d 65 72 20 53 69 6d 70 73 6f 6e   // 13-byte string &amp;quot;Homer Simpson&amp;quot;
                                            // total 38 bytes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s very simple to figure out the meaning of the sentence « &lt;em&gt;Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves&lt;/em&gt; » reported in the headline of MessagePack website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main features of MessagePack are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s designed for network communication and to be transparently converted from and to JSON;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it supports in-place updating, so it&amp;rsquo;s possible to modify part of a stored object without reserializing it as a whole;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has a flexible &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call&#34;&gt;Remote Procedure Call (RPC)&lt;/a&gt; and streaming API implementation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it supports &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking&#34;&gt;static-type-checking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;supported-data-types&#34;&gt;Supported data types&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data types listed by the specification are very similar to those in JSON, that is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integer&lt;/strong&gt; represents an &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boolean&lt;/strong&gt; represents &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nil&lt;/strong&gt; represents &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Float&lt;/strong&gt; represents a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point&#34;&gt;IEEE 754&lt;/a&gt; double precision floating point numbers including &lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Infinity&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;String&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;raw type&lt;/code&gt; and it represents a UTF-8 string;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binary&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;raw type&lt;/code&gt; and it represents a binary data using byte array;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Array&lt;/strong&gt; represents a sequence of objects;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map&lt;/strong&gt; represents a dictionary (key-value pairs of objects);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extension&lt;/strong&gt; represents a tuple of data whose meaning is defined by applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-naive-benchmark&#34;&gt;A naive benchmark&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point our reasoning was focused on &lt;strong&gt;space efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;, but a good theoretical computing scientist would have criticized us since we didn&amp;rsquo;t mention &lt;strong&gt;time complexity&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, the process of data &lt;em&gt;compression&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;decompression&lt;/em&gt; is not negligible. We can analyze and compare, for example, the time required to parse a JSON document and to unpack a MessagePack document: that&amp;rsquo;s not completely scientific, but it&amp;rsquo;s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrote two &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/en/&#34;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; scripts to execute 1 million JSON parsing and 1 million MessagePack unpacking operations of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/salvatorecordiano/facile-it-message-pack-benchmark/blob/master/document.json&#34;&gt;sample document&lt;/a&gt; containing the same data in the two formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simplified version of the code could be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;// inside script &amp;quot;test_parse_json.js&amp;quot;
for (var i = 0;i&amp;lt;1000000;i++) {
    JSON.parse(jsonDocument); // JSON document parsing
}

// inside script &amp;quot;test_unpack_msgpack.js&amp;quot;
for (var i = 0;i&amp;lt;1000000;i++) {
    msgpack.unpack(msgPackDocument); // MessagePack document unpacking
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To easily profile our scripts we can run them as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;aiace:msgpack parallel$ time node test_parse_json.js

real	0m47.296s
user	0m47.202s
sys	0m0.059s

aiace:msgpack parallel$ time node test_unpack_msgpack.js

real	1m47.244s
user	1m47.050s
sys	0m0.120s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers are self-explanatory: the MessagePack binary is &lt;em&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt; than the minified JSON, but MessagePack deserialization is clearly &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; than JSON parsing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going on, we also need to say that all tests are executed in the following described environment and the full code of this benchmark is free available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/salvatorecordiano/facile-it-message-pack-benchmark/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;// Machine

CPU: 2.200 MHz Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770HQ CPU @ 2.20GHz

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MessagePack allows to save more than 40% of network bandwidth consumption with little more than one line of code. A smaller payload means that less data are transmitted, and that&amp;rsquo;s very useful in &lt;strong&gt;mobile&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet of Things (IoT)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; applications, where there&amp;rsquo;s special care in power efficiency; but we should also pay attention to the overall size of each request, to avoid the absurd situation in which the &lt;em&gt;header&lt;/em&gt; is larger than the &lt;em&gt;payload&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(computing)&#34;&gt;overhead&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to underline that, while MessagePack is supported by over &lt;a href=&#34;http://msgpack.org/#languages&#34;&gt;50 programming languages&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be particularly efficient from a computational perspective, and can be hard to debug due to being non human-readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/kotlin-intro/logo_Kotlin.svg&#34; alt=&#34;Kotlin&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java is an &lt;strong&gt;old&lt;/strong&gt; programming language. Version 1.0 was released in 1996 by Sun Microsystems and  even though it has evolved and grown a lot over the past twenty years it is still carrying on some bad design choices such as &lt;em&gt;null&lt;/em&gt; (ask &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare?section=3#Apologies_and_retractions&#34;&gt;Tony Hoare&lt;/a&gt;), primitive types or lack of a proper function type. With the last version of the language (Java 8) Java tried to address some of these problems introducing concepts such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html&#34;&gt;lambda expression&lt;/a&gt;. Although these additions clearly represent a step forward for the language I still have the feeling that they are just &lt;em&gt;patches&lt;/em&gt; applied to &lt;strong&gt;mitigate problems&lt;/strong&gt; and not to solve them at their very source. For example &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; could be used to reduce NPE (Null Pointer Exception) but it is clearly not designed for &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mariofusco/status/780770300178956289&#34;&gt;this purpose&lt;/a&gt; and lambda expressions, implemented in Java 8 with SAM types, still force you to write an interface only to define a &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-android-world&#34;&gt;The Android world&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above concerns about Java are even more problematic within the Android world where, due to the notorious &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html&#34;&gt;fragmentation&lt;/a&gt; (a huge amount of devices are stuck with an &lt;strong&gt;outdated VM&lt;/strong&gt;), you are forced to target lower Java versions (6 and 7).
Google is addressing the problem with its new compiler &lt;a href=&#34;https://source.android.com/source/jack.html&#34;&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; that enables &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the features of Java 8 maintaining backward compatibility with older OS versions. But still it lets us deal with the verbosity of the language and it doesn’t truly solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-hope&#34;&gt;A new hope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/kotlin-intro/kotlin_helloworld.png&#34; alt=&#34;Kotlin Hello World!&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011 the JetBrains team (the guys behind IntelliJ and so Android Studio) unveiled &lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org/&#34;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt;, a new programming language that targets the JVM (and can also be compiled to JavaScript).
Kotlin is a statically-typed language that combines Object Oriented and functional features enforcing no particular philosophy of programming, and it introduces a whole new set of concepts and tools that helps making the code &lt;strong&gt;safer, cleaner and much more readable&lt;/strong&gt;.
Thanks to its nature it works everywhere Java do and it is also &lt;strong&gt;interoperable&lt;/strong&gt; with it, meaning it will not force you to rewrite the entire codebase to taste it: you can add it to your project a little at a time (&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@sergii/using-kotlin-for-tests-in-android-6d4a0c818776#.lyvd3h43x&#34;&gt;maybe starting with tests&lt;/a&gt; 😉). It also features a REPL &lt;code&gt;kotlinc-jvm&lt;/code&gt; that allows you to test language features with no effort (see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html#running-the-repl&#34;&gt;doc&lt;/a&gt; form more info).
I am going to rapidly cover some features of Kotlin that address the previously mentioned Java limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;null-safety&#34;&gt;Null-safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kotlin &lt;strong&gt;a variable cannot be null&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want or need a variable to be &lt;em&gt;nullable&lt;/em&gt; you have to add &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to the variable type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34;&gt;val x: Int = null // compile error
val y: Int? = null // ok
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this information the compiler sees &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Int?&lt;/code&gt; as two completely different types and can therefore enforce the &lt;a href=&#34;http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html&#34;&gt;null-safety&lt;/a&gt; of your variables.
The &lt;code&gt;?.&lt;/code&gt; allows you to safe call methods on nullable variables without throwing NPE but simply returning null at the end of the  call chain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34;&gt;val x: Int? = null
x?.toString()?.substring(2) // no NPE, returns null
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; operator (Elvis operator) allows you to provide a “default” value when the variable is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34;&gt;// The two expressions are semantically equivalent:
text?.length ?: -1
(text.length != null) ? text.length  : -1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;higher-order-functions-and-lambdas&#34;&gt;Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kotlin is possible to declare a method (or more generally a function) that returns or takes another &lt;strong&gt;function as parameter&lt;/strong&gt;. The syntax to define the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html&#34;&gt;function type&lt;/a&gt; is similar to other languages such as Scala or Swift and is very &lt;strong&gt;intuitive&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34;&gt;val function: (T1, T2) -&amp;gt; R = {t1, t2 -&amp;gt; r}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-classes&#34;&gt;Data classes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34;&gt;data class City(val name: String, val state: String)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html&#34;&gt;Data classes&lt;/a&gt; address the verbosity of Java when dealing with classes that have the only purpose to hold data. With a single line you get &lt;code&gt;equals()/hashCode()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; and getters/setters for free (and if you are a Java developer you already knows the benefits!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java has to maintain backward compatibility with previous versions and still has to support the huge amount of developers and codebases present all around the world; therefore it is natural that every new feature and design change is to be considered, weighted and reasoned really carefully, inevitably &lt;strong&gt;slowing down its evolution&lt;/strong&gt;. But this does not have to mean that us, as Android developers, “tied” to the JVM, should not try more modern and advanced languages such as Kotlin. At bottom, a part of our job (one of the best!) is to try and &lt;strong&gt;experiment&lt;/strong&gt; new technologies and to &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt; new concepts and techniques that improve our ability to address problems in the best possible way (and of course, to have some fun 😄).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that it is fundamental for a software engineer to be &lt;strong&gt;exposed to more than a single programming language&lt;/strong&gt;: learning new patterns, exploring other programming paradigms or simply using and understanding a never-seen syntax has an immeasurable value for our growth and most of the times it turns out to be unexpectedly useful even when coding with ”our” language.
So why not do it with a language that allows us to continue working on projects targeting our beloved JVM?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Event-driven serverless applications</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/event-driven-serverless-applications/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;If we think about computing in the Cloud Era, our mind is immediately drawn towards virtual machines and containers. Therefore, for example, when building a production environment with both approaches we think about the need of patching the operating system and/or upgrading the container. At the end of 2014 &lt;strong&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/strong&gt; (AWS) announced a new service called &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&#34;&gt;Lambda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, that allows us to focus on business logic and not on infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-lambda&#34;&gt;What is Lambda?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported on their website: « &lt;em&gt;AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code highly-available in the cloud in response to events and it automatically performs all the administration of the compute resources for you&lt;/em&gt; ». In the previous sentence is condensed all the power of Lambda, that we can summarize with the following key concepts: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#serverless-architecture&#34;&gt;serverless architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#high-availability&#34;&gt;high-availability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#event-driven&#34;&gt;event-driven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#zero-administration&#34;&gt;zero administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/event-driven-serverless-applications/aws-lambda-key-concepts.png&#34; alt=&#34;AWS Lambda key concepts&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;serverless-architecture&#34;&gt;Serverless architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lambda is completely &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo;, a term that can be considered misleading: obviously Lambda uses physical servers to run your code, but we, as the service&amp;rsquo;s users, don’t take care of everything required to do it. We just need to upload our code on AWS console and it handles capacity, scaling, monitoring, logging and security without any server to manage.
Strictly speaking, functions are executed in containers, and kernel-based virtualization is very useful in this context, because it allows to build multiple isolated environments in short time.
A more detailed explanation of serverless architectures can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;high-availability&#34;&gt;High-availability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Lambda maintains compute capacity across multiple availability zones in each region - at the moment there are 8 regions distributed among Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific - in this way Lambda is able to protect your code against data center failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;event-driven&#34;&gt;Event-driven&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Event-driven&amp;rdquo; means that a Lambda function is triggered when an event occurs, so the flow of the application is mainly driven by events. In this kind of architecture all Lambda functions are event consumers, because they are invoked by an event and they have the responsibility to process it.
An event comes to life, for example, whenever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new item is created on an Amazon DynamoDB table;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a file is deleted on an Amazon S3 bucket;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an Amazon API Gateway is called;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;et cetera&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but we can also use AWS SDK to invoke a function directly on a mobile or web app back-end.
This is a good way to write application logic without designing and maintaining a centralized workflow.
More about event-driven programming &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;zero-administration&#34;&gt;Zero administration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the work you usually need to do in order to assure that your application works in a scalable, reliable and durable way is taken care by the service itself.  Behind the scenes the system performs all the needed administration for the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, code and security patch deployment, code monitoring and logging, and automatically matches the incoming rate of functions invocation for us, to assure capacity provisioning and automatic scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lambda-functions&#34;&gt;Lambda functions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code we run on AWS Lambda is called a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;lambda function&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;. The name &amp;ldquo;lambda&amp;rdquo; derives from the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet. In general a &lt;em&gt;lambda&lt;/em&gt;, also called &lt;em&gt;anonymous function&lt;/em&gt;, is a function that&amp;rsquo;s defined inline (sometimes called &lt;em&gt;closure&lt;/em&gt;) and passed to some other function, method or procedure, to be stored or executed: the &lt;em&gt;anonymity&lt;/em&gt; is given by the fact that we don&amp;rsquo;t give a name to the function, but we just define it at the moment of need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;supported-languages&#34;&gt;Supported languages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now Lambda functions natively support code written in &lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Node.js&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;, but we can run C, Go and PHP using a Node.js wrapper. Hopefully Amazon will add official support for other languages such as PHP, Go, C, Swift and many more. We can also include libraries, even native ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stateless-code&#34;&gt;Stateless code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we write a function our code must be &lt;strong&gt;stateless&lt;/strong&gt;, thus everything begins and ends in the same request, and any persistent state is stored in a storage service (not necessarily within Amazon world). Keeping functions stateless is the keystone to enable the system to instantly launch new instances when needed, to serve the incoming events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the code, each Lambda function has many configuration informations, such as name, description, runtime, handler, memory, max execution time and execution role. A detailed explanation is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction-function.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;invocation-types&#34;&gt;Invocation types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can invoke a Lambda function directly, for example using the Invoke API, or indirectly, for example using the Amazon API Gateway. A function invocation needs to specify the &lt;code&gt;InvocationType&lt;/code&gt;. There are three invocation types allowed: &lt;code&gt;RequestResponse&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DryRun&lt;/code&gt;. Each one of them has different purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;RequestResponse&lt;/code&gt;: in this case we expect a &lt;strong&gt;synchronous&lt;/strong&gt; behavior. The function receives input parameters as an event, and returns a result;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt;: in this case we expect an &lt;strong&gt;asynchronous&lt;/strong&gt; behavior. The function receives input parameters as an event, returns immediately no value, but continues its execution asynchronously;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DryRun&lt;/code&gt;: it&amp;rsquo;s used to verify the access to a function without running it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/event-driven-serverless-applications/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-behaviour.png&#34; alt=&#34;Synchronous vs asynchronous behaviour&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lambda-alternatives&#34;&gt;Lambda alternatives&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serverless is a new cloud computing trend, and accordingly many cloud providers – in addition to Amazon - started offering their own &lt;em&gt;Function as a Service&lt;/em&gt; (FaaS), for example &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; with its &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/functions/&#34;&gt;Cloud Functions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;IBM&lt;/strong&gt; with its &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.ibm.com/openwhisk/&#34;&gt;OpenWhisk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Auth0&lt;/strong&gt; with its &lt;a href=&#34;https://webtask.io/&#34;&gt;WebTasks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; with its &lt;a href=&#34;https://functions.azure.com/&#34;&gt;Azure Functions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions are very useful when we want to build lightweight applications based on &lt;em&gt;microservices&lt;/em&gt; with no server. Their approach could be considered a way to achieve fine-grained microservices, in which there is a relation one-to-one between functions and endpoints instead of one service per one resource: for this reason they are often referred to as &lt;em&gt;nanoservices&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could help developers in focusing on the code, while only charging for code really running in an infrastructure that&amp;rsquo;s able to autonomously grow upon demand, without lots of efforts in managing it. With functions, we can see our code as a series of small and independent building blocks, that can be easily replaced or connected with other blocks using events. Also, Lamba could help small team in reusing existing skills while adopting different languages, in order to develop software that better matches business&amp;rsquo; requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How PHP 7 &amp; TDD helped me sleep better</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-enemies-of-programming&#34;&gt;The enemies of programming&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you will agree with me, &lt;strong&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/strong&gt; is the enemy of programming.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe we fear only one thing more than that: &lt;strong&gt;being interrupted&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/how-php-7-tdd-helped-me-sleep-better/interruption.png&#34; alt=&#34;Why you shouldn&#39;t interrupt a programmer (by Jason Heeris)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing code we have to think really hard, we use complex abstractions, we go through long business workflows and so on&amp;hellip; fatigue and interruptions are the main enemies of those in this line of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-experience&#34;&gt;My experience&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my day job, I do all this mental juggling on a pretty big project, which is based on PHP 5.5, Symfony 2.8, Doctrine etc.; luckily, in this project we use a good deal of &lt;strong&gt;good practices&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;automated software testing&lt;/strong&gt; is one of those. I actually switched to this job to learn about doing automatic testing, continuous integration and other best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost half a year ago &lt;strong&gt;I became a dad&lt;/strong&gt;. It has been great, and you also get some unexpected perks! For example, my colleagues got me this gift for my son:
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/how-php-7-tdd-helped-me-sleep-better/blue-elephpant.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A blue elePHPant!&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we can say that his future is pretty clear&amp;hellip; But don&amp;rsquo;t say this to my wife!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pregnancy, many of my friends and fellow parents warned me half jokingly about one thing: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;sleep now, you&amp;rsquo;ll be deadly tired after!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Now I can say that they were a bit exaggerating, but I can&amp;rsquo;t deny that, having a child takes a toll on your sleep schedule&amp;hellip; Even if, as in my case having a 9 to 6 office job, my wonderful wife does all the parenting heavy lifting (and I consider myself pretty lucky for having her!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months after my son was born I also had the opportunity to start &lt;strong&gt;a new, fresh project&lt;/strong&gt;. To be completely honest, it was not actually fresh: it was a &lt;strong&gt;complete rewrite&lt;/strong&gt; of an internal service that&amp;rsquo;s used to manage the invoices for multiple business units inside our company. I knew pretty well that the old system had to be replaced, so I was put in charge of redoing it from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the issue with the old system (and the main reason behind the rewrite) was &lt;strong&gt;maintainability&lt;/strong&gt;: we had no tests, we had no proper development environment, and its design wasn&amp;rsquo;t that great; also, bureaucracy and invoicing are the core domain of the system, so it was inherently complex. It was the perfect environment to witness the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory&#34;&gt;broken windows theory&lt;/a&gt; in action: the code base got worse over time, one patch, copy paste or quick fix at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, as anyone that&amp;rsquo;s passionate in technology would do, I took the opportunity to use a lot of new shiny tools: I picked &lt;strong&gt;PHP 7&lt;/strong&gt;, which had just been released, and started the project with something familiar to me but still pretty new and cool, &lt;strong&gt;Symfony 3.0&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-i-found-to-be-useful&#34;&gt;What I found to be useful&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rambled and thought about this project a lot in the past months with my colleagues, because the old system was costing us a lot of overhead in usage and maintenance, and we had a pretty clear idea of what its problems were, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to study a lot before starting to write the first classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I had to spend &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; time thinking about an object oriented design for my project, but I was rapidly able to start writing code with confidence. In the end, most of this confidence came from a few choices that I pursued during the development of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tdd-and-high-coverage&#34;&gt;TDD and high coverage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first choice that I am pretty satisfied about is &lt;strong&gt;automatic testing&lt;/strong&gt;: I already knew the advantages of doing tests and Test Driven Development, but in the previous project that practice was not introduced from the start, so not all the codebase was covered, and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t (or wouldn&amp;rsquo;t?) do TDD 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case instead &lt;strong&gt;I wanted to write nearly everything with TDD&lt;/strong&gt;, and keep a &lt;strong&gt;very high threshold for the minimum coverage&lt;/strong&gt; achieved through automatic testing. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on a ~92% test coverage, and I feel proud about it. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a mere &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s hit 100%!&amp;rdquo; mindless goal (&lt;a href=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/blog/ita/software-testing-coverage-vs-efficacia/&#34;&gt;since it&amp;rsquo;s pointless&lt;/a&gt;), but it fueled &lt;strong&gt;a positive feedback cycle&lt;/strong&gt; instead: the more I used TDD in writing new classes, the more the coverage rose and stayed high; at the same time, I found myself inspecting the coverage reports to find missing spots, and that allowed me to discover many edge-cases that I didn&amp;rsquo;t test and should have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I still left some parts without coverage or specific tests, since it was pointless to test them (e.g. Doctrine entities), while I covered some parts multiple times, since they were &lt;strong&gt;critical paths&lt;/strong&gt; inside my application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unit-tests-to-the-rescue&#34;&gt;Unit tests to the rescue!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the main critical advantage that TDD gave me was &lt;strong&gt;focus even on strained days&lt;/strong&gt;: I wrote the classes starting from unit tests, giving all my effort to one piece of code at a time, without having to keep in mind the entire project with its complexities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then wrote some functional tests to assure that the &lt;strong&gt;collaboration between my unit-tested objects&lt;/strong&gt; was fine, and this later step was also useful in delaying the definition of the classes as services inside the Symfony DI container. I was also &lt;strong&gt;able to change my mind&lt;/strong&gt; a few times on some details of the design without having to suffer mental confusion or rewrite too much code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;php-7-scalar-and-return-types-declarations&#34;&gt;PHP 7: scalar and return types declarations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second good choice was &lt;strong&gt;PHP 7&lt;/strong&gt;: among the reasons behind it as the language version of choice for this project were the &lt;a href=&#34;http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php&#34;&gt;two main new features&lt;/a&gt; introduced: &lt;strong&gt;scalar types&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;return type declarations&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/how-php-7-tdd-helped-me-sleep-better/return-types-everywhere-meme.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Return types, return types everywhere!&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Facile.it, I worked as C++ developer, and oh boy! did I miss scalars and return types!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I came onboard of the PHP community right on time&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, I thought&amp;hellip; So I took advantage of the situation to start using all these new features. I enjoyed having again the possibility to typehint strings and integers; I discovered how return types declaration enforces the cohesion of your objects really well, making it &lt;strong&gt;rightly painful to return different things&lt;/strong&gt;: it became impossible to return &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; OR &lt;em&gt;null&lt;/em&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in my tests I found myself writing a lot of this kind of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$result = $testClass-&amp;gt;method();
$this-&amp;gt;assertInstanceOf(SomeClass::class, $result);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did this more than once, just to realize that I was wasting my time! This was normally the first TDD step on PHP 5.x code, but now this kinds of assertion were futile, because the return type was already checked at a language level! Great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return types also proved themselves to be a &lt;strong&gt;double-edged sword&lt;/strong&gt; in some cases, especially on Doctrine entities: they are really useful to enforce consistency in your values, since they trigger a &lt;code&gt;\TypeError&lt;/code&gt; each time you call a getter method on a erroneously empty property, but &lt;strong&gt;you can&amp;rsquo;t use them on nullable fields&lt;/strong&gt;, since it will break your application at any time during execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, having return types declared on your business-logic classes it&amp;rsquo;s pretty useful, even more when used in conjunction with TDD: every time you define a mock you are forced to declare expectations and predictions with the right types, so it &lt;strong&gt;indirectly helps maintaining the collaboration contract between objects&lt;/strong&gt;, without too much hassle. If I changed a method&amp;rsquo;s signature that was mocked somewhere, the mock would break the test, &lt;strong&gt;highlighting the issue and making the tests&lt;/strong&gt; (and an high coverage) &lt;strong&gt;even more valuable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, these and other &lt;strong&gt;good practices are helpful&lt;/strong&gt; for both your job and your personal life: you can go a long way in being fit and in the best shape while working, but stressful and (good) distracting events are unavoidable: you&amp;rsquo;ll often have to fight stress, fatigue or distractions, and there will be days where you can&amp;rsquo;t be at the top of your game, for any number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since programming is a mental job, I think that having instruments and good practices in your toolset is invaluable, being them the &lt;strong&gt;essential tools of our craft&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, I hope that those little life/programming lessons I learned in these months will be useful to other people like me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facile.it devs @ PhpDay 2016</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/php-day-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Almost like a nice tradition, we went to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2016.phpday.it/&#34;&gt;PHP Day conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; this year as well; this time too it was held in Verona, on &lt;strong&gt;May 13th and 14th&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We participated and attended numerous talks and, &lt;a href=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/blog/ita/php-day-2015/&#34;&gt;as last year&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted to write a light summary; this won&amp;rsquo;t be a full &amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo;, but our intent instead is to highlight what captured our interest most, or what we found more valuable for our everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, we hope to give a brief glimpse of what we experienced to fellow developers that hadn&amp;rsquo;t the opportunity to attend, and to tempt some of you to join conferences like this one or those in the PHP community at large, for your personal and professional growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talks are in chronological order, and we linked the slides when available. Enjoy your reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;technical-talks&#34;&gt;Technical Talks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-api-is-a-ui&#34;&gt;Your API is a UI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christopher Hoult (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/choult&#34;&gt;@choult&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - 11:00 – 12:00 - track 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting and very smooth talk. It stayed pretty general with nice advices about &lt;strong&gt;API development&lt;/strong&gt;, but showed some reasoning about a pyramidal &amp;ldquo;scheme of priorities&amp;rdquo; that we should follow, deriving from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&#34;&gt;Maslow&amp;rsquo;s hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dip-your-toes-in-the-sea-of-security&#34;&gt;Dip Your Toes in the Sea of Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James Titcumb (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/asgrim&#34;&gt;@asgrim&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - 14:30 – 15:30 - track 1 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/asgrim1/dip-your-toes-in-the-sea-of-security-phpday-2016&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we saw an interesting overview of &lt;strong&gt;security issues&lt;/strong&gt; that a web application can encounter. It ranged from basic SQL injection, to timing attacks (that were explained pretty well!), to CSRF protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-regular-expressions&#34;&gt;How I learned to stop worrying and love Regular Expressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jordi Boggiano (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/seldaek&#34;&gt;@seldaek&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - 15:30 – 16:30 - track 1 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://slides.seld.be/?file=2016-05-13+How+I+learned+to+stop+worrying+and+love+Regular+Expressions.html&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we went from basic &lt;strong&gt;regular expressions&lt;/strong&gt;, to basic pattern recognition, to advanced usage; the speaker took also the time to explain to us how the regex engine works, through thorough examples of pattern matching advancement and backtracking. Also, bonus points for the slides! They were pretty neat, and everything was themed to the &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;/em&gt; movie, from images to phrases used in the examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dockerizing-your-php-ci-pipelines&#34;&gt;Dockerizing your PHP CI Pipelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul Dragoonis (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/dr4goonis&#34;&gt;@dr4goonis&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - 17:00 – 17:30 - track 2 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://dragoonis.com/talks/phpday-may-2016/#/&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was about &lt;strong&gt;using Jenkins with Docker&lt;/strong&gt; and having optimized pipelines for fast builds and short commit-to-deploy times. It should have been a 1-hour-long talk, so the speaker had to cut short on a lot of things, but I took a lot of useful advice from it nonetheless. Fortunately, he was kind enough to give the extra bits of his talk in the unconference track the day after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;drinking-beer-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-php&#34;&gt;Drinking Beer with a Raspberry Pi and PHP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew Carter (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/AndrewCarterUK&#34;&gt;@AndrewCarterUK&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2 - 15:30 – 16:30 - track 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was uncommon but really funny. The speaker explained that programming the Raspberry Pi is possible even with PHP! He showed us a working example of an AaaS (Alcohol as a Service) machine. It was a simple tool with a liquid pump and a flow detector that is used to fill up glasses with any kind of drink. It can be activated via API as any regular service. The speaker also explained how it is possible to communicate with external devices via the powerful IO pins using Unix device files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;evolution-of-web-application-architecture&#34;&gt;Evolution of Web Application Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kore Nordmann (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/koredn&#34;&gt;@koredn&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2 - 15:30 – 16:30 - track 2 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://qafoo.com/resources/presentations/phpday_2016_2016/evolution_of_web_application_architecture.html&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk covered the &lt;strong&gt;evolution of the technological stack&lt;/strong&gt; behind a normal web application, from single-server to multi-server architecture. Each addition to the stack was discussed and weighted, without taking for granted any single step: from adding a master-slave database configuration, to caching session and\or query results. This gave us a pretty clear idea of &lt;strong&gt;when and why&lt;/strong&gt; such steps should be taken while adding new functionalities to a project, or overcoming technical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-functional-in-php&#34;&gt;Being functional in PHP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David de Boer (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ddeboer_nl&#34;&gt;@ddeboer_nl&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2 - 16:30 – 17:00 - track 1 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/boerdedavid/being-functional-in-php-php-day-italy-2016&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was an &lt;strong&gt;introduction to functional programming&lt;/strong&gt;. The speaker compared highly declarative languages such as Erlang with PHP. He demonstrated the options we have to adopt functional programming in PHP. Basic concepts were covered in a clear and simple way: mapping, reduction, function composition and higher-order functions. Particular focus was given to the use of pure functions and their main advantage: the absence of side effects. Finally, the speaker went through an interesting comparison between OOP and functional programming, showing their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;keynotes&#34;&gt;Keynotes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploying-php-7&#34;&gt;Deploying PHP 7&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rasmus Lerdorf (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/rasmus&#34;&gt;@rasmus&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - 09:45 – 10:45 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://talks.php.net/phpday16#/&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rasmus is a veteran at PHPDay, and he gives opening keynotes here almost every two years. This year&amp;rsquo;s was obviously about PHP 7, and it was more a technical talk than else. It went from &lt;strong&gt;benchmark data&lt;/strong&gt; to technical tips on how to smooth the transition to this new major version of PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-badoo-saved-1m-switching-to-php7&#34;&gt;How Badoo Saved $1M Switching to PHP7&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikolay Krapivnyy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2 - 09:45 – 10:45 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/216377/verona_php_2.pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://techblog.badoo.com/blog/2016/03/14/how-badoo-saved-one-million-dollars-switching-to-php7/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about this technological switch made the rounds on a lot on PHP-related websites some months ago; this talk was very technical too, and it showed us how big is Badoo&amp;rsquo;s technological stack, with 3000 servers, 1000 of which running PHP. It gave us a nice overview of the &lt;strong&gt;technical challenges&lt;/strong&gt; that their tech team endured to do this upgrade, and how it gave them the possibility to save more than a half of their hardware resources; also&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Faster Web with HTTP/2</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/faster-web-with-http-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/faster-web-with-http-2/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;HTTP is the protocol that powers the Web. It was originally designed in 1996 for transferring and manipulating simple text-based documents (mainly hypertext resources).
Nowadays it&amp;rsquo;s been adopted for many different purposes. It&amp;rsquo;s used for: multimedia content transfer, rich real-time session-based web applications, API messages dispatch, Internet of Things and much more.
For this reason, the HTTP specifications are continuously updated, by adding new features and improving performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2015, the latest version 2.0 was standardized with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540&#34;&gt;RFC 7540&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
This introduced major differences on how the low-level protocol works.
From the application perspective, very little has changed: requests, responses, resources, headers and HTTP methods are still there.
New features have been added such as the possibility to &lt;strong&gt;push resources to the client&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason that led to HTTP/2 is &lt;strong&gt;improving performance&lt;/strong&gt;.
Previous versions of HTTP had critical problems that were not addressable without changing the low-level communication mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;http-1-1-issues&#34;&gt;HTTP/1.1 issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/2 deals with many of the performance issues of HTTP/1.1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP/1.1 doesn&amp;rsquo;t support headers compression even though it would be particularly effective against text-based data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP/1.1 &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining&#34;&gt;request pipelining&lt;/a&gt; is not so efficient due to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking&#34;&gt;head-of-line blocking&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern web applications have complex resources that are linked to each other. HTTP/1.1 servers have no way to send all the related resources at once in order to avoid additional round-trips;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP/1.1 connections are designed to have short lifespans. Unfortunately, web resources change over time and additional connections are required to fetch the updated data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have adopted several tricks to mitigate these problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session data is usually persisted on the server to minimize the amount of headers sent at every request;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reduce latency and to achieve request multiplexing, browsers open several TCP connections during page load. This is not recommended: it consumes many more resources (both client-side and server-side) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control&#34;&gt;TCP congestion avoidance&lt;/a&gt; techniques are no longer effective;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent web applications prefer leaving connections open to reduce connection setup latency for subsequent requests;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-changed&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s changed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/2 is &lt;strong&gt;no longer text-based&lt;/strong&gt;; this means debugging could be somewhat difficult without using special tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Server and client communicate by sending small binary messages named &lt;strong&gt;Frames&lt;/strong&gt;.
There are different types of frames. The most important ones are &lt;code&gt;DATA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HEADERS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SETTINGS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PUSH_PROMISE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/2 uses the concept of &lt;strong&gt;streams&lt;/strong&gt;. Each stream is identified by an ID and it&amp;rsquo;s allocated for every request/response lifecycle.
Several streams can be active at the same time on the same connection: this provides &lt;strong&gt;real request pipelining and multiplexing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each frame contains the ID of the stream they refer to. Thus, frames of different streams can be interleaved without interfering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servers, by sending the &lt;code&gt;PUSH_PROMISE&lt;/code&gt; frame, can allocate new streams without waiting for an explicit request from the client. By the virtue of this, &lt;strong&gt;the server can push resources to the client&lt;/strong&gt; and reduce the number of round-trip messages needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Http headers (both requests&amp;rsquo; and responses&amp;rsquo; ones) are always compressed and they are sent using one or more &lt;code&gt;HEADERS&lt;/code&gt; frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6.1&#34;&gt;Response Status-Line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5.1&#34;&gt;request Request-Line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; have been moved. They are now stored in the header section via special headers (pseudo-headers): &lt;code&gt;:method&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:path&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:status&lt;/code&gt;, etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Response Status-Line Reason-Phrase&lt;/em&gt; has been completely removed: there is no equivalent in HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servers and clients may use &lt;code&gt;PING&lt;/code&gt; frames to check the underlying connection&amp;rsquo;s state and to keep the connection alive even for a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;support-by-servers-and-user-agents&#34;&gt;Support by servers and user agents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/2 is actually a fork of &lt;a href=&#34;http://dev.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper&#34;&gt;SPDY&lt;/a&gt;, a protocol developed by Google.
A lot of different servers and clients already supported the SPDY protocol, so the transition from SPDY to HTTP/2 was pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/2 was officially released in May 2015; since then &lt;strong&gt;all major web servers have added support for HTTP/2&lt;/strong&gt; such as Apache HTTP, Apache Tomcat, Nginx, IIS and Jetty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All major browsers now support HTTP/2&lt;/strong&gt;, e.g. Firefox, Chrome, IE and Edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A the moment, they only allow HTTP/2 over TLS via &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301&#34;&gt;ALPN&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-agl-tls-nextprotoneg-04&#34;&gt;NPN&lt;/a&gt; as Protocol Negotiation mechanisms.
RFC 7540 considers the case of HTTP/2 being used on cleartext connections as well, but actually this is not extensively used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;additional-resources&#34;&gt;Additional resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.http2demo.io/&#34;&gt;Http2demo.io&lt;/a&gt; compares performance metrics between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about HTTP/2, you can read the official specifications (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540&#34;&gt;RFC 7540&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) or download the book &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://daniel.haxx.se/http2/&#34;&gt;Http2 explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which also examines the reasons behind HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog restyling: switching to Hugo and GitHub Pages</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/switching-to-hugo-and-github-pages/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/switching-to-hugo-and-github-pages/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, we went through a bit of a restyling in the last few days, and our blog changed a lot in terms of appearance and structure.
We are very happy with those changes, but the reason behind this transition is not just a simple template change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-we-were-searching-for&#34;&gt;What we were searching for&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before, we were using an hosted CMS to run the blog, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghost.org/&#34;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. We were happy with the results, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t our concern to administrate the server or bother about other hosting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as many other developers, we were &lt;strong&gt;hitching for something&lt;/strong&gt; more aligned with our inclinations: we wanted a tool that was closer to our daily jobs and our skills. We were also having &lt;strong&gt;problems during the revision phase&lt;/strong&gt; of the articles, since multiple persons couldn&amp;rsquo;t review and edit an article at the same time, fearing the risk of overwriting each other&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then came down with a list of requirements for our blog; we wanted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy review of articles&lt;/strong&gt;: parallels reviews are a must&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;an easy workflow&lt;/strong&gt;: no major overhead, since the blog contributions are voluntary amongs us; we want to dedicate all the time to writing the articles, not wrestling with technical difficulties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no security flaws&lt;/strong&gt;: this point disqualified Wordpress and other famous CMS solutions; we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like to spend time staying ahead of possible security risks, or have to worry over the hosting and installation problems that a widespread used CMS has&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy image hosting&lt;/strong&gt; and embedding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy management and modifications of the &lt;strong&gt;template&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy integrations of previously used &lt;a href=&#34;https://disqus.com/&#34;&gt;Disqus comments&lt;/a&gt; and Google Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;preferably &lt;strong&gt;markdown content format&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for &lt;strong&gt;multilanguage articles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;git-and-the-github-pages&#34;&gt;Git and the GitHub pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first solution that came to us was obviously &lt;strong&gt;Git&lt;/strong&gt;, the everyday tool for a team of developers working on the same piece of code (or text, in this case). We obviously then thought of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt; as an hosting solution: that is ideal, since we already have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/facile-it&#34;&gt;Github organization&lt;/a&gt; in place, so an organization homepage/site would perfectly fit the bill for our blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we set our eyes to that hosting solution, we started to search for a solution for building our blog. The proposed solution was &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;: it&amp;rsquo;s a static site generator, developed in Go, which fitted almost all of our requisites; also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it generates the static HMTL site live, with a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/extras/livereload/&#34;&gt;live reload&lt;/a&gt; functionality&lt;/strong&gt;: while you edit your markdown article, the site refresh itself on each save of the file(s), so you can see a live preview of what you&amp;rsquo;re writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are many templates ready to be used, and we &lt;a href=&#34;http://themes.gohugo.io/future-imperfect/&#34;&gt;chose one&lt;/a&gt; to be modified to our needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the templates are built with the Go Templating engine, and with some easy manual edits we obtained all the requested features: multi-author support, link between translated articles, recent articles and top categories in the sidebar&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploying&#34;&gt;Deploying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step needed to smooth out our workflow was to find a &lt;strong&gt;deploy strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. Github pages need to have the site content published onto the master branch, and we obviously wanted to separate the source code of the site from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed an easy way to reproduce this steps, ideally with a script commited to the repo, ready for everyone to use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;generate&lt;/strong&gt; the static site with Hugo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;avoid mixing (and committing)&lt;/strong&gt; the static copy with the source files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commit the files to the master branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo normally generates the static copy in the &lt;code&gt;./public&lt;/code&gt; directory; to achieve this we used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy&#34;&gt;a script that I found on GitHub itself&lt;/a&gt; that solved this exact problem. We started an empty &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; branch, &lt;strong&gt;detached&lt;/strong&gt; from master:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout -b source --orphan
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our Hugo site inside it, and we put the &lt;code&gt;./public&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;.gitIgnore&lt;/code&gt;, so each static generation would not be committed. We then prepared the deploy script that, after generating the static site, uses a Git subtree approach to commit its content to the master branch, with a commit message of &lt;code&gt;publish: &amp;lt;last commit message from source&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;et-voilà-here-we-are&#34;&gt;Et voilà, here we are!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we hope that you will enjoy our new blog at least as much as we enjoyed building it ! Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Droidcon It 2016</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/droidcon-it-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/droidcon-it-2016/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/droidconit-recap/logo_droidcon_it.png&#34; alt=&#34;Droidcon It&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third edition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://it.droidcon.com/2016/&#34;&gt;Droidcon IT&lt;/a&gt; was, as expected, a great conference, full of interesting talks and people coming from all over the world. We saw a lot of GDEs (&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/experts/all/technology/android&#34;&gt;Google Developer Expert&lt;/a&gt;) and also some Developer Advocates from Google, although it was not organized directly by the company. Back in March the Android team surprisingly released the brand new &lt;strong&gt;N Developer Preview&lt;/strong&gt; earlier than expected, so this year we were already able to talk about the new features in Android N and analyze them. Furthermore, there was talk of &lt;strong&gt;Kotlin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;RxJava&lt;/strong&gt; and a lot of other useful and interesting topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to recap the event and make some considerations about the most interesting (and funny) talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keynote-wojtek-kalicinski-https-twitter-com-wkalic&#34;&gt;Keynote - &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/wkalic&#34;&gt;Wojtek Kalicinski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day 1 keynote was all about the N Developer Preview and was given by Wojtek Kalicinski, a developer advocate directly from Google.
Wojtek went through all the new improvements of the platform, both from user&amp;rsquo;s and developer&amp;rsquo;s point of view. Here’s a short summary of the most relevant ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-window support&lt;/strong&gt;: probably the most requested user feature. I’ve always thought that its implementation would have been relatively straightforward, given the already responsive UI of Android, and in fact the code changes that are needed to support this feature are minimal. Just make sure you don’t lock screen orientation using &lt;code&gt;android:screenOrientation&lt;/code&gt; in your manifest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better notifications&lt;/strong&gt;: in addition to a visual change of the notification panel, apps will now be able to let the user interact with bundled notifications individually or to reply from the notification itself directly. Moreover, if the app already supports Android Wear notifications, most of this will come for free, since the APIs are the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doze improvements&lt;/strong&gt;: the battery saving mode called Doze, now works — in a less aggressive mode — when the phone is in the user pocket or hands, and not only when the phone is stationary. Wojtek said that most of the apps should continue to work without any change — or eventually &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/intl/ko/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html#assessing_your_app&#34;&gt;minimal&lt;/a&gt; —, but he strongly encouraged to test apps against this new feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAVA 8 features!&lt;/strong&gt;: finally Google will allow developers to use a limited set of features from the latest version of the language (already two years old) including &lt;em&gt;lambdas&lt;/em&gt; (🎉) and &lt;em&gt;default and static interface methods&lt;/em&gt; (TODO: add DP2 apis). All of this is possibile thanks to the Jack&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; toolchain which is able to compile Java 8 syntax to Java 6 compatible bytecode: in this way, old phones’ support is guaranteed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other changes include improvements to &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/intl/ko/preview/api-overview.html#background_optimizations&#34;&gt;Project Svelte&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/intl/ko/preview/api-overview.html#data_saver&#34;&gt;Data Saver&lt;/a&gt; feature, the addition of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/intl/ko/preview/api-overview.html#tile_api&#34;&gt;Quick Settings Tile API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/intl/ko/preview/api-overview.html&#34;&gt;many more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting and encouraging aspect coming out from the keynote and the N Preview release itself, is the fact that Google is, finally, trying to fix the Android updates issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/droidconit-recap/n-preview-updates.png&#34; alt=&#34;N Preview Updates&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only the release of the new OS preview six months before its public release — instead of three — is really useful for third party developers to update apps to support new APIs, but hopefully it will also help phone manufactures to keep their custom Android implementations more aligned with the stock version release cycle. This will result in a better user experience and, more importantly to us, a better developer experience, making it closer to the iOS world where developers are not required to support five years old OS versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;perfmatters-for-android-hasan-hosgel-https-twitter-com-alosdev&#34;&gt;#PERFMATTERS for Android - &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alosdev&#34;&gt;Hasan Hosgel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/alosdev/perfmatters-for-android-droidcon-turin-2016&#34;&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk was all about performance in Android. The speaker analyzed why #&lt;strong&gt;PERFMATTERS&lt;/strong&gt; on Android: the typical mobile user is generally &lt;em&gt;impatient&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;intolerant&lt;/em&gt; and even just a couple of extra seconds during the start-up could make the difference in the user&amp;rsquo;s choice to use or not your app. Hasan went through a lot of interesting tips and tricks to improve performance, such as avoiding multi-pass nested layout — a topic discussed in more detail by Huyen Tue Dao during her &lt;a href=&#34;#lean-layouts&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; —, avoiding memory leaks or having a cache on disk for data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance is crucial to &lt;strong&gt;engage the user&lt;/strong&gt; and I think the speaker did a great job in summarizing useful tips to improve it. Moreover most of them doesn’t alter the readability or the maintainability of the code, as is often the case for performance driven code changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-it-flow-unidirectional-data-flow-architecture-in-android-benjamin-augustin-https-twitter-com-dorvaryn&#34;&gt;Let it flow! Unidirectional data flow architecture in Android - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dorvaryn&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benjamin Augustin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/dorvaryn/let-it-flow&#34;&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of patterns to structure the presentation layer (UI) in Android is still infrequent. During the last couple of years we have seen a lot of discussions about &lt;strong&gt;MVC&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;MVP&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;MVVM&lt;/strong&gt; patterns within the Android developers community, and some implementations of them.
During the talk the speaker presented a new approach that takes some concepts from the web development world like &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/flux/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://redux.js.org&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The concept in a nutshell is that the UI, in addition to being as dumb as possible, should also be &lt;strong&gt;stateless&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, the UI listens to state changes pushed by the business logic and updates itself accordingly.
Benjamin chose to focus more on the practical aspects and so he made the concept clear by directly building an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Dorvaryn/unidirectionalDataFlow&#34;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; using Kotlin and RxJava.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally likey approach that Benjamin showed us, since it has a lot of advantages. It makes the UI state completely &lt;strong&gt;predictable&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;reproducible&lt;/strong&gt;: it allows us to represent an app state without the need to go through all the steps needed to reach it, thus it can be very useful in reproducing a bug or testing a particular situation. The problem is that, as you can see from the demo app, it adds a lot of boilerplate code and it&amp;rsquo;s also much more verbose and difficult to implement without tools like RxJava or Kotlin, that might be problematic to some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;play-everywhere-providing-a-consistent-experience-across-very-different-devices-alessandro-bizzarri-http-it-droidcon-com-2016-speakers-alessandro-bizzarri-dima-kunin-http-it-droidcon-com-2016-speakers-dima-kunin&#34;&gt;Play everywhere: providing a consistent experience across very different devices - &lt;a href=&#34;http://it.droidcon.com/2016/speakers/alessandro-bizzarri/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alessandro Bizzarri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://it.droidcon.com/2016/speakers/dima-kunin/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dima Kunin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two speakers showed a high-level tour of how at &lt;strong&gt;Spotify&lt;/strong&gt; they  are able to provide a consistent experience across different devices — defined as the combination of its physical form and its OS.
They created their own &lt;strong&gt;design language&lt;/strong&gt; to support the majority of platforms used to define almost everything, from color palette and buttons style to animations and sounds.
They explained also how they use a &lt;strong&gt;C++ library&lt;/strong&gt; common to all platforms to reuse code; in particular on Android they use it through the NDK, a toolset to include C or C++ code in your app and call it from Java code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a light talk but still it was interesting to see how a big company like Spotify finds solutions to scale and maintain a &lt;strong&gt;consistent and engaging UX&lt;/strong&gt; across all of its user-base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;loving-lean-layouts-huyen-tue-dao-https-twitter-com-queencodemonkey-a-name-lean-layouts-a&#34;&gt;Loving lean layouts - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/queencodemonkey&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huyen Tue Dao&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&#34;lean-layouts&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/queencodemonkey/droidcon-italy-2016-loving-lean-layouts&#34;&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker gave a really great talk about one of the best ways to keep an app smooth and responsive: &lt;strong&gt;optimize layouts&lt;/strong&gt; to be as flat as possible. The Android UI layer will call &lt;code&gt;measure()&lt;/code&gt; and    &lt;code&gt;layout()&lt;/code&gt; methods — two times in the case of &lt;code&gt;RelativeLayout&lt;/code&gt; — through all the hierarchy of views to be able to draw the layout; so, for example, having a useless root level  or useless views will result in more measure/layout passes, thus poor performance. Huyen explained how sometimes the solution to this problem may be to choose the right view or layout, but it could be useful to know that there is always the possibility to implement a custom &lt;code&gt;ViewGroup&lt;/code&gt; to mitigate the number of measure/layout passes or even a totally custom &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt; that overrides &lt;code&gt;onDraw()&lt;/code&gt; to draw everything by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk was very easy to follow and really useful: most of the advices covered are often ignored because singularly they have less impact, but, if taken all together and especially as good habits, they could really make the difference in maintain the &lt;strong&gt;UI smooth and lag-free&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;android-reactive-programming-with-rxjava-ivan-morgillo-https-twitter-com-hamen&#34;&gt;Android reactive programming with RxJava - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hamen&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ivan Morgillo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During last couple of years RxJava has been echoing all over the Android developers community and given its huge popularity I was surprised to see that Droidcon IT offered only one talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately Ivan Morgillo is a topic expert — he also wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/rxjava-essentials&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about RxJava and Android — and during the talk he went through some of the &lt;strong&gt;basics of reactive programming&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;code&gt;Observables&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Observer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Subscription&lt;/code&gt;…) and a lot of useful &lt;strong&gt;operators&lt;/strong&gt;, which are one of the strengths of RxJava and Reactive extensions (Rx*) in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I was hoping for a more theoretical talk with an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of embracing the reactive pattern in our Android projects. It was instead a lot practical and it covered a great number of common use cases where reactive programming could really help to make code mode readable and maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-can-do-better-with-kotlin-svetlana-isakova-https-github-com-svtk&#34;&gt;You can do better with Kotlin - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/svtk&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Svetlana Isakova&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/svtk/you-can-do-better-with-kotlin&#34;&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin has recently reached &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/02/kotlin-1-0-released-pragmatic-language-for-jvm-and-android/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.0 version&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it is gaining a lot of attention within the Java community and especially the Android one. A lot of developers — me included — are in fact hoping that Google will make it the default programming language for its mobile OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin is a &lt;strong&gt;modern&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;pragmatic&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Android-friendly&lt;/strong&gt; programming language, with robust supporting tools since it is developed from the people behind IntelliJ (thus, Android Studio). It could be mixed with Java code — thus making the switch painless — since there is no Kotlin SDK but just JDK plus extensions, and it includes a lot of modern concept such as &lt;em&gt;data classes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;null-safety&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;extension functions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;lambdas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker showed also ANKO, a DSL written in Kotlin, that uses &lt;em&gt;lambdas with receivers&lt;/em&gt;, to create layouts and views and allows to write code like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;verticalLayout {
    val name = editText()
    button(&amp;quot;Say Hello&amp;quot;) {
        onClick { toast(&amp;quot;Hello, ${name.text}!&amp;quot;) }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was one of the most interesting to me, as it persuaded me to try and deepen my knowledge of Kotlin. Svetlana was very good at showing the main features of the JetBrains language and at explaining how they convert in Java code, an aspect that I found very useful to mutate my mindset with new concepts and  syntaxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fun-things-you-cando-in-kotlin-maciej-górski-https-github-com-mg6maciej&#34;&gt;fun things (you: CanDo &lt;in Kotlin&gt; ) = … - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mg6maciej&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maciej Górski&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mg6maciej/fun-things-you-CanDo-in-Kotlin&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second Droidcon talk about Kotlin was a very fun one, with the speaker acting a funny scene where a nephew tries to explain to his granpa why he should use &lt;strong&gt;Kotlin instead of Java&lt;/strong&gt; with a live coding session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&#39;embed-container&#39;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVu_0TIiH8Q&#39; frameborder=&#39;0&#39; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of the talk was still in live programming (without slides) and showed some Kotlin feature in practice. It covered some advanced topics such as functional programming, operator overloading, infix functions, laziness and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was funny and informative to watch a &lt;strong&gt;live coding talk&lt;/strong&gt; and for sure it made me more curious and confident about Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Droidcon IT is already, after three editions, the &lt;strong&gt;point of reference&lt;/strong&gt; for the Android community in Italy and this year too it lived up to the expectations. We saw a lot of well-known speakers and developers such as the Googlers Nick Butcher and  Wojtek Kaliciński. It was a conference rich of interesting talks in addition to those summarized in this post, ranging between al lot of various topics such as TDD, UX, tools and many more. The only thing that surprised me was the lack of talks about Android Wear: perhaps Google is slowing down to push this platform among developers?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Json Web Token</title>
      <link>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/json-web-tokens/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/json-web-tokens/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://engineering.facile.it/images/json-web-tokens/logo.svg&#34; alt=&#34;JWT&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my study about JWT, I was searching for a smart method to authenticate a request, without querying the database each time to check the applicant reliability.
I needed a token or something similar with the ability to validate itself and flexible enough to customize the validation strategy.
Imagine for example a web application where a user can login and obtain a &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo; with his name and an expiration time, and this pass will let him ask for resources until the pass expires, and only if the issuer is trusted.
Thanks to JWT&amp;rsquo;s self verification capabilities, I could discard every request where the token is invalid (a fake token not signed by my application) or expired.
Beyond this specific use case, JWT can be also useful to securely transmit data to other applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me introduce the standard: JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519&#34;&gt;RFC 7519&lt;/a&gt; that defines a compact, self-contained and secure way for transmitting information between two parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using javascript object notation to represent the data means two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saving lots of bytes when the token goes over the network, &lt;strong&gt;because of it&amp;rsquo;s size&lt;/strong&gt; it can be sent over an URL or inside an HTTP Header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it can be &lt;strong&gt;easily parsed by a browser&lt;/strong&gt; and consumed by a client application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more clear when comparing JSON to other standards like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language&#34;&gt;SAML&lt;/a&gt; that uses a very verbose XML structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JWT token can be trusted because it is digitally signed using a secret (usually with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code&#34;&gt;HMAC&lt;/a&gt; algorithm) or a keypair with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA&#34;&gt;RSA&lt;/a&gt;.
Its payload contains all the required data to verify itself and, for example, transport the user data to avoid querying the database more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-the-token-presents-itself&#34;&gt;How the token presents itself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A token is represented as three base64 encoded strings joined by two points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;headers&#34;&gt;Headers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the string contains the headers, &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;alg&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; is the algorithm used to secure the token and &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;typ&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; is the type; in this case as we can see that I used an HMAC SHA256 to sign the JWT token:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;alg&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;HS256&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;typ&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;JWT&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;payload&#34;&gt;Payload&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part is the payload: it&amp;rsquo;s the data sent with the token. It contains metadata and information like expiration, audience or subject, and whatever you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;sub&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1234567890&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;John Doe&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;admin&amp;quot;: true
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All data is organized in &lt;strong&gt;claims&lt;/strong&gt;, statements about an entity (typically, the user). There are three types of claims: reserved, public, and private claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reserved claims&lt;/strong&gt;: a set of predefined claims, conceived to provide a set of useful information. Some of them are: &lt;code&gt;iss&lt;/code&gt; (issuer), &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; (expiration time), &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt; (subject), &lt;code&gt;aud&lt;/code&gt; (audience), among others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public claims&lt;/strong&gt;: defined at will but, in order to avoid collisions, they should be defined in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml&#34;&gt;IANA JSON Web Token Registry&lt;/a&gt; or be described as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private claims&lt;/strong&gt;: custom claims created to share information between parties that agree with using them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sign&#34;&gt;Sign&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third part of the string is the sign, obtained from hashing headers and payload with a secret using the algorithm described in headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said before the more interesting feature of JWT is in it&amp;rsquo;s flexibility. It can be created with the claims you need, carry your data and validated on other claims (standard or not).
As an example, if on authentication I want to be sure that the token is issued by my application and that it is not older than 1 hour I can generate a token with a payload like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;iss&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1234567890&amp;quot;, // my application code
  &amp;quot;exp&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1459868400&amp;quot;, // 2016-04-04 15:00:00 Expiration time
  &amp;quot;uid&amp;quot;: 159, // the user id
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Alessandro Galli&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once my application receives a request with this token, an authenticator component will check the two claims (&lt;code&gt;iss&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt;) to be sure of the assertions made before, and then validate the sign. Furthermore, with the additional claims it can login the user without querying the database and complete the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach results in a stateless authentication removing all problems related to session storage, CORS+cookies requests and CSRF protection, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a solid standard, JWT has been adopted by a large number of users and it has libraries for almost every programming language: PHP, Java, Go, Python, Javascript, Ruby, Elixir, Scala, .NET. You can find a full list of available and trusted libraries on &lt;a href=&#34;https://jwt.io/#libraries-io&#34;&gt;JWT.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next weeks, I will write a post and release my personal authentication example, using PHP with the Symfony framework.&lt;/p&gt;
